Limits and Future of Computing
=====================================

Although computers can perform mind boggling amounts of work each second, there are fundamental limits to what problems we can use them to solve. There are problems that can not be solved algorithmically and others that we believe to have no algorithmic solution that is efficient enough for practical use. Furthermore, expanding the power of computers to solve the problems they are capable of is becoming more and more challenging. Computer scientists, electrical engineers and physicists are all working on the technologies that will power computers of the future and provide new models of computation.
