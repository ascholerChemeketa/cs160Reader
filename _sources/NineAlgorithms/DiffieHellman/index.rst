Diffie Hellman (Ch 4) 
=========================================

The Diffie Hellman algorithm is interesting in its own regards. The fact that an
algorithm can allow two people to devise a secret that is unknown to a third person
who is listening to everything they say is a clever bit of trickery. But it is also 
important in that it introduces some of the mathematical tricks that more advanced
encryption algorithms also make use of.

These pages have resources for exploring the algorithm and figuring out how the
math in it works.
