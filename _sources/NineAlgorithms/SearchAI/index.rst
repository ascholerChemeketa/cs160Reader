=========================================

Many problems in computer science can be thought of as a search for the best answer through a set of possible answers. Solving a puzzle, to playing chess and to planning a route can all be attacked with the same basic strategy.

This chapter focuses on how search algorithms work and how they play a roll in many solving problems in the subfield of computer science known as *artificial intelligence*.
