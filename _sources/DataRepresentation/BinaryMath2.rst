Other mathematical operations can be adapted in similar ways to work with binary numbers. Often, because binary numbers are so simple (0 or 1), computers use specialized algorithms that are more efficient than the ones we use when calculating by hand. We will not examine any of these algorithms in detail, but the animation below demonstrates how the standard multiplication algorithm works with binary numbers.
