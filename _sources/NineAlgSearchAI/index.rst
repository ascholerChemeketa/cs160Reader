Search & AI
=========================================

Many problems in computer science can be thought of as a search for the best answer through a set of possible answers. Solving a puzzle, playing chess, and planning a route can all be attacked with the same basic strategy.

This chapter focuses on how search algorithms work and how they play a role in many solving problems in the sub-field of computer science known as *artificial intelligence*.

.. note::
	*Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future* does not cover search algorithms.
