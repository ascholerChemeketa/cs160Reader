Chapter Concept Summary
============================

This chapter included the following concepts from computing.

.. index::
    single: file; binary
    single: file; text
    single: split

- **Text Files** - Files in which data is stored as ASCII text. Thus even numbers are stored as
  strings. These files are easy for humans to work with, but less efficient for computers.

- **Binary Files** - Files in which data is stored in its raw binary form. This is more efficient
  for computers to work with, but very difficult for humans to work with unless they use
  special tools.

Summary of Python Keywords and Functions
------------------------------------------- 
- **Close** - The ``close`` procedure closes a file after you are done processing it.
- **Open** - The ``open`` procedure opens the passed file for either reading or writing.
- **Split** - The ``split`` function can be called on a string to break it up at a specified
  character into a list of strings. For example, if ``message = "Nora,Jones,15"``
  then ``message.split(",")`` would return ``['Nora', 'Jones', '15']``.
