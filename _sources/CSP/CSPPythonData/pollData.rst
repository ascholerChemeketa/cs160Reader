Our first data set: Air pollution in the United States
=======================================================

This first data set that we're going to explore is from *The Guardian* newspaper's data blog.
It is a record of the air pollution in various cities. According to the World Health
Organization, 2.5 micrometer pollution is particularly deadly, because it more easily gets
`deep into our lungs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates>`_. To give a sense of how
dangerous this kind of pollution  is, an annual mean amount of just 5 Âµg/m3 (microgram per 
cubic meter of air) was linked with a 13% increased risk of heart attacks.


We will use just the US data. It is in a large text file that looks like this:

::

    Aberdeen, SD :13 :8
    Adrian, MI :15 :9
    Akron, OH :18 :11
    Albany, GA :18 :11
    Albany-Lebanon, OR :14 :8
    Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY :13 :8
    Albuquerque, NM :12 :7
    Alexandria, LA :20 :12
    ...

There are three columns separated by colon (':') characters:

- The city and state, separated by a comma.
- The annual mean amounts of particulate pollution that's 10 micrometers in
  diameter, measured in terms of micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) of air.
  This is abbreviated as PM10.
- The annual mean amounts of particulate pollution that's 2.5 micrometers in
  diameter (even smaller), measured in the same micrograms per cubic meter of
  air. This is abbreviated as PM2.5.
