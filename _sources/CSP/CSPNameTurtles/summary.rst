Chapter 5 - Summary
============================

Chapter 5 included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: comment
    single: function
	single: object
	single: procedure
	single: string

- **Comment** - A comment describes one or more lines of code.  Comments are ignored by the computer.
  A comment in Python starts with ``#``.  The computer will ignore everything from the start of the
  comment to the end of that line.
- **Function** - A function returns a value. An example of a function is ``Screen()`` which creates
  and returns a screen (drawing space) object.
- **Procedure** - A procedure does an action, but doesn't return a value.  An example of a procedure
  is ``forward(100)`` which makes the turtle go forward by 100 pixels.
