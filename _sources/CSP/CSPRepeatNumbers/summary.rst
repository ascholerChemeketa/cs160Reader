Chapter Summary
============================

This chapter included the following concepts from computing.

.. index::
    single: accumulator pattern
    single: comparison operator
    single: logical expression
    single: while loop

- **Accumulator Pattern** - The accumulator pattern is a set of steps that processes a list
  of values.  One example of an accumulator pattern is the code to sum a list of numbers.
- **Comparison Operators** - The symbols like ``==`` or ``<`` used to compare values and
  come up with a True or False answer . 
- **Logical Expression** - An expression that produces a Boolean True/False value.
- **While Loop** - A loop that continues as long as a logical expression is true. While
  loops are used when we want to say "do these steps as long as..." instead of "do these
  steps for each of these values" (which is a for loop).

Summary of Python Keywords and Functions
-------------------------------------------- 

- **while** - Used with a logical expression as ``while expression:`` to construct a
  loop that continues as long as the expression is true.
- **True/False** - The literal values that can be used to represent a logical true or
  false value.
