============================

This chapter included the following concepts from computing.

..	index::
    single: abstraction
    single: actual parameter
    single: argument
    single: call
    single: define
    single: formal parameter
    single: function
    single: parameter
    single: procedure

- **Abstraction** - Abstractions in code are things that allow us to focus on the big picture -
  like ``drawSquare`` instead of the details required to actually do the job.
- **Argument** - An actual parameter is a value passed into a procedure or function
  when it is called.  In ``forward(50)`` the actual parameter is 50.  This is also called an
  **actual parameter**.  
- **Call** - You can call or run a procedure or function by using the name of the procedure or
  function followed by values to pass into the procedure or function.  An example is
  ``forward(50)``.  This is also known as **executing** or **running** a procedure or function.
- **Define** - You can define a new procedure or function in Python using the ``def`` keyword.
- **Execute** - Execute means to **run** or **call** a procedure or function.  
- **Formal Parameter** - A formal parameter is named input in the definition of a procedure
  or function.  This is also called a **parameter**.  
- **Function** - A function is a named set of instructions that *returns a result*.  An example
  is the ``abs(num)`` which returns the absolute value of the num.  
- **Library** - A library is a named group of related procedures and functions.  An example
  is the Turtle library.
- **Parameter** - A parameter is input to a procedure or function that is named when you define
  the procedure or function. It will be assigned a value when you call the procedure or function.
  This is also called a **formal parameter**.   
- **Procedure** - A procedure is a named set of instructions that *does not return a result*,
  but can cause something to happen like the turtle ``forward(amount)`` procedure. 
- **Run** - To run a procedure or function use the name of the procedure or function in your
  program.  This is also known as **calling** or **executing** a procedure or function.
