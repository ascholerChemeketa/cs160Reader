This chapter included the following concepts from computing.

.. index::
    single: boolean expression

    single: if
    single: logical expression

- **Boolean Expression** - A Boolean expression is one that is either true or false.  This is
  also called a **logical expression**.  
- **Condition** - A condition is something that is either true or false. This is also called
  a **Boolean expression** or a **logical expression**.  
- **Conditional Execution** - Conditional execution means that one or more statements are
  executed only when a condition (**logical expression**) is true.  This is also called a
  **conditional**.  The statements that are executed when the condition is true are called
  the **body**. 
- **Flowchart** - A flowchart is a diagram that shows the execution paths for a program.
  The conditionals are shown as diamonds.  
- **Logical Expression** - A logical expression is one that is either true or false, like
  ``x == 3`` which will return true if x is equal to 3.  This is also called a **Boolean expression**.  

Summary of Python Keywords and Functions
-------------------------------------------
- **Else** - The keyword ``else`` is used to execute one or more statements in a block following
  the ``else`` when the condition in the ``if`` part of the statement is false.  An ``else``
  must always have an ``if`` statement before it.
- **Elif** - The keyword ``elif`` is used when you want to have a conditional with 3 or more
  possibile options.  Add as many ``elif`` statements as you need after an ``if`` and before a ``else``. 
- **If** - The Python keyword ``if`` is used to start a condition. It is followed by a Boolean
  expression and then has one or more statements in the body of the loop that are executed only
  if the Boolean expression is true.
