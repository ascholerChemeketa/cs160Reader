Chapter Exercises
============================

Design your own drawing using turtle graphics. You should use multiple colors, and your
design must be complicated enough to features multiple procedures, including at least one procedure
that calls other procedures you have written.

Here are some ideas:

* The current year number as block-style digits on a colored background.
* A multicolor flag on a flagpole.
* A few trees and a sun shining on them.

Remember that although we can't make curves, you can draw circles by setting a large ``pensize``
and then doing ``forward(0)`` to make a colored dot.

    Use this space to describe the procedures you will write. Like in my design, don't worry about
    writing code yet, just describe the parts of the task. Try to make sure that each one is simple enough
    to do in about ~10 lines of code. If it sounds more complex than that, break it down further
    and design procedures that will do the various sub-problems.

    Now use this space to implement your program. 

    Write one procedure at a time and test as you go!
