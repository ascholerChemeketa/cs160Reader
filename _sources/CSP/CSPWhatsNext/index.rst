Are you interested in extending your knowledge of Python or using it to solve problems of your own design?
Here are some resources to check out.


Full Python On The Web
----------------------------

There are many websites that let you run Python program. However, unlike this book, which supports
a limited set of Python libraries, these sites usually support all the common Python libraries.
(This book is more limited because it actually turns your Python code into Javascript so it can
run directly in the web browser. These sites run your code on a server using "real" Python.)

Here are two options:

`replit <https://replit.com/languages/python3>`__ 

`online-python <https://www.online-python.com/>`__

Python On Your Computer
----------------------------

`Thonny <https://thonny.org/>`__ is a super simple editor for writing Python to run on your computer.
It will automatically install a copy of Python, so you can install **Thonny** and start writing code
without worrying about anything else.

`Mu <https://codewith.mu/en/>`__ is another good choice for getting started writing Python to run
on your computer.

You can also install `Python <https://www.python.org/>` and use any text editor you like to write
code. This route is only recommended if you already are used to using text editors and working
from the command prompt.


More Python
----------------------------

`*How To Think Like A Computer Scientist <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html>`_
is a free ebook that covers basic concepts in more depth than this
book and extends to much more advanced programming topics. If you want to get serious about
Python programming, check it out.


Applications
-----------------------------

There are python libraries for making games (PyGame, Panda3D), for making applications that
have Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) - buttons, windows, etc... (tkinter, Kivy), for
doing data science on large data collections (Pandas, NumPy), and just about anything else
you can think of. Use google to look for "Python YOUR_INTEREST" and see what you can find.
