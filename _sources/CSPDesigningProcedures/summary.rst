    single: bottom up implementation
    single: top down design
    single: precondition

- **Bottom up implementation** - The process of building a program by first building small low-level,
  simple procedures and then using those to help build more complex procedures.
- **Precondition** - Something that the code in a procedure assumes to be true. The caller of a 
  procedure is responsible for making sure the Precondition is true before calling it.
- **Top down design** - The process of breaking a complex task into smaller problems that are
  easier to solve.
