**A. According to your sources, what is the purpose/use of the technology?**

Smart locks are locks that use a cell phone app or numeric code to open a door instead of a key.
In my first source, the smart locks are being used on an apartment building.

**B. According to your sources, how does the technology use computation?**

The exact data is not described well.
The user has a smartphone app that they use to control the technology.
The lock must receive some kind of information that allows it to see what device is sending the
signal to open and only admit residents—so there must be some kind of unique ID for
each resident.

**C. How is this use of computation beneficial and who benefits?**

The building does not have to worry about replacing locks if keys are lost or stolen.
The privacy policy of the company that made the locks says it could use people's location
data for marketing purposes.

**D. How is this use of computation harmful and who is harmed?**

Residents who were forced to use the system lost privacy—both the building and a third 
party would have records of their coming and going. And residents who lacked a working
cell phone were potentially locked out of their building—having your cell phone
run out of battery before getting home is a lot more frequent for many people than losing their keys.
