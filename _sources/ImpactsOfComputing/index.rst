Impacts of Computing
=====================================

Computing has fundamentally reshaped society, particularly in recent
decades as computing devices have become ubiquitous and the Internet
has connected all of those devices.

These changes wrought by computing have had effects on society
and individuals both positive and negative. This is the nature of
tools—almost every invention can be put to use for good or evil. Even
if we all agreed on which uses of a technology were positive and which
were negative (which we often don't), avoiding the negative consequences
of a technology can be challenging. Sometimes trying to prevent misuse of
technology is impossible without preventing any use of it. Sometimes the
negative effects are side effects of the positive uses of a technology—a
necessary cost of getting some benefit.

Given this, it is important for us to think critically about who benefits
from a use of technology and who is harmed by it, and how. It is important
to understand clearly understand the tradeoffs as we make use of or try
to limit the use of a new tool.

This chapter expands on this idea and provides a framework for you to
explore technologies we are learning about to consider their impacts.
