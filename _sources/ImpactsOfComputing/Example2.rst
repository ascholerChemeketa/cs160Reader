Example Two
=========================================

This example describes the impacts of street map applications on society.

--------------------------------

Street map software, such as the original `MapQuest
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapQuest>`_, the dominant
`Google Maps <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps>`_,
and the open-content `OpenStreetMap
<https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap>`_, allow users
to browse maps on the web and plan driving routes. They often have other
features, such as searching for businesses in a particular geographical
area, planning trips with multiple stops, and predicting traffic.

The main data used is a spatial description of the map itself, including
not only the coordinates of significant landmarks and turns in the
road, but often detailed descriptions of shapes.  That information
is rendered into map tiles that can be presented to a user. Most
street map software also has some integration with top-down satellite
imagery to present a different view. Google Maps offers `Street View
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View>`_, which allows users
to view some locations as though standing nearby, using VR stitching to
assemble hypothetical views out of photography gathered by Google.

Access to detailed, accurate street maps that can be accessed on the web
and shared has many benefits. Software predictions about driving times are
more precise than estimating distances on a paper map, and can incorporate
live information about traffic and construction. Street View is a
useful feature for people who navigate visually to be able to recognize
landmarks along their route, and has been leveraged to make unexpected new
applications including `games <https://www.geoguessr.com/>`_. Businesses
can leverage their appearance on the map to attract customers. People
can share locations and directions for a variety of meetings.

There is also harm to both people who use the
map and people whose locations appear on the
map. Street View suffers from many `privacy concerns
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View_privacy_concerns>`_.
Coverage of street map software is incomplete, and some
locations do not appear or—worse—appear wrongly, so that
people relying on the software are `led away from their destinations
<https://web.archive.org/web/20091207222555/http://www.generalwarren.com/directions/directions.html>`_.
Cartography is complex, and by relying on software, people lose the
skills of making and reading maps.
