Analyzing Impacts
=========================================

In this class, you will be asked on several assignments to find one or more articles about
some use of computation and describe it as well as its positive and negative impacts. You
will do this by answering a series of four questions. They are listed below as questions A-D.
Below each question is a series of prompts to consider. You do not necessarily need to address
each prompt - they are simply guides of things you should consider while answering. 

You should generally be able to answer each question in one to a few sentences. You should list
your sources (and link to them if online) at the bottom of your answer.

Describing the Technology
-------------------------------

A. According to your source(s), what is the purpose/use of the technology?
    * What problem(s) was it designed to solve?
    * What things is it used to do?

B. According to your source(s), how does the technology uses computation?
    * All computation makes use of data. What data is involved?
    * How does the technology process the data? What are the inputs and outputs? What happens in between?
      *Don't worry about trying to describe the actual low-level steps of the algorithm involved, 
      just the high level process*

Describing the Impacts
-------------------------------

C. How is this use of computation beneficial and who benefits?
    * How do users of the technology benefit from it?
    * How does society as a whole benefit from the existence of the technology?


D. How is this use of computation harmful and who is harmed?
    * What harm is there to the user?
    * What harm is there to people targeted by the technology?
    * What harm is there to people excluded from using the technology?
    * What harm is there to society?


The following pages will show you a few examples.
