Most Populated and Least Populated States
======================================================

If we want to dig into patterns in pollution, there are many hypotheses we might want to
test:

- Maybe bigger states have more *stuff* and that leads to more pollution?
- Maybe smaller states have more things crammed into a smaller place, and
  that leads to more pollution?
- Maybe richer states have more industry, and that leads to more pollution?
- Maybe poorer states are home to more polluting industries like coal
  powered factories and that leads to more pollution?
- Maybe more populous states have more people (so more cars and houses...)
  and that leads to more pollution?

To try to answer these questions, we need to calculate average pollution for a specific state.

We will also need some data about which states are large and small and which are richer and
poorer. The top three largest states in population are:

==================   ============
State                Population
==================   ============
California           38,332,521
Texas                26,448,193
New York             19,651,127
==================   ============

And the three smallest are:

====================    ============
State                   Population
====================    ============
District of Columbia    646,449
Vermont                 626,630
Wyoming                 582,658
====================    ============

The three largest states in land area are Alaska, Texas, and California.  
The three smallest are Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island.

The three *richest* states (by per capita income) are Maryland, Alaska, and New Jersey.
The three poorest are Arkansas, West Virginia, and Mississippi.
