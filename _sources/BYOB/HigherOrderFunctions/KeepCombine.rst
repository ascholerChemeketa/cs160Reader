All of the checkpoint exercises will work on the lists shown to the right. Start by making lists that look like them.

Hint:

The combine with block should have two blanks in the reporter you use for "smashing things together". Like this:

If you put something in one of the blanks it won't work right!

        **Keep long words**

        Use **Keep** to filter the list of words down to only words with a length of more than 4.

        **Select Minimum**

        Make a reporter block that returns the smaller of two values. Use **Combine** and that block to combine the list of numbers - you should get 68. Use them to combine the words, you should get "i" (the lowest alphabetically).

        **Select Longest**

        Make a reporter block that returns the longer of two words. Use **Combine** and that block to combine the list of words - you should get "programming", the longest word
