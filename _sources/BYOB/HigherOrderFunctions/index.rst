Higher Order Functions
=================================

This tutorial focuses on Higher Order Functions - the idea that we can treat functions like we do data: We can pass a function to another function to tell it how to do its job - just like we pass information (like the number 45) to functions to specify how they should work (turn 45 degrees).

It may sound complex, but it opens up powerful ways to think about solving problems.
