User Input
==============================

The video below introduces how you can have a program ask the user questions and use the answers in your
code.

Experiment with the techniques you see - I would recommend pausing periodically and trying to recreate
the programs you see.


.. youtube:: xzRIXAPSJBI
    :height: 315
    :width: 560


.. pseudo_h3:: Checkpoint Exercises
    :class: underlined


.. tabbed:: exercise1

    .. tab:: Checkpoint A

        **Rectangle with specified size:**

        Try to make a program that asks the user for a height and a width and draws a rectangle with those dimensions.
        Your program will have to ask two separate questions

    .. tab:: Hint

        You will need to make your own variable and store the answer to the first question before you ask the second question.
        BYOB's built in ``answer`` variable only remembers the last answer.

        The say block is totally optional, it makes the sprite announce what it is drawing.
