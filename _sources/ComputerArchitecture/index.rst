Computer Architecture & The Machine Cycle
================================================

Computers are built as a sequence of abstractions. Logical gates hide the messy details of electrical signals behind clean Boolean logic; logic gates in turn are used to construct circuits that perform functions like "add number **a** to **b**" or "remember the last value input"; these circuit are in turn used to build the higher level components that programs actually interact with - things like the processor, the main memory and input and output devices.
