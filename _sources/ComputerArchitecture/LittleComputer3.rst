The Little Computer - Assembly
=================================

Software developers and computer scientists sometimes have to deal with machine level code. They might be trying to use some special hardware feature a high level language does not support; or writing the code to interact with some new piece of hardware; or trying to understand a program that someone else has written as part of doing a security analysis. When they do, they do not do so by writing or reading the raw 0's and 1's of the machine code, they use :ref:`assembly language <assembly languages>` - a human readable translation of machine language.

The Little Computer supports an assembly language that makes it easier to read and write programs. It allows us to think at a slightly more abstract level and say things like *"add X"* instead of *"add the value at memory location 10"*. This video introduces it:

You can access the assembler here: 
`Launch the Little Computer assembler <../_static/littleComputer/littleComputerAssembler.html>`__  *(Control or Command click to open in a new window)*

To test out a program after assembling it, use the Little Computer:
`Launch the Little Computer <../_static/littleComputer/littleComputer.html>`__  *(Control or Command click to open in a new window)*
