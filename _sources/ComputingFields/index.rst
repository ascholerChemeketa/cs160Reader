Computing Related Fields
==============================

The modern world of computation is too vast for anyone to master all the details. Not only has the design of computer hardware and software grown incredibly complex, but computing devices are being applied to solve problems in all aspects of modern life. A wide range of skills are required to build a computational device, develop software for it, decide how to make use of it and actually put it to use.

The career/education options that directly relate to building and using computers can be broken down into the five categories listed below. Although sometimes the borders between the fields are fuzzy, they serve as a good starting point for thinking about what kind of career might be of interest to someone who wants to go into high tech and what kind of education they will need.
