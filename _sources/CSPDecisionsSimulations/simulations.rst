Simulations
========================

.. index::
    single: simulation

Computer powered simulations have a wide variety of uses. Simulations are used to train people
in professions ranging from pilots to surgeons. They are used to provide entertainment in the
form of managing a virtual soccer team or driving a race car. And they are used to test out
scientific theories and make predictions from them.
