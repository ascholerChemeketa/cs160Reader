Logic Gates & Circuits
=======================

Computers represent all information as bits - values that can be thought of as 1/0, on/off, or true/false. To process information, a computer manipulates these bits according to the rules of a system called Boolean logic. This chapter will introduce you to that logic and the kinds of basic circuits computers use to do things like add numbers and store information.
