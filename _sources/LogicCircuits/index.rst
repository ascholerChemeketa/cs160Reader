Logic Circuits
====================

Computers represent all information as bits that can be thought of as on/off, 1/0 or true/false. Typically in a computer system, on means a high voltage and off means a low voltage. To manipulate information, a computer changes these bits. The logical rules that describe how bits may be combined is known as Boolean logic. This chapter will introduce you to that logic and the kinds of basic circuits computers use to implement that logic.
