    Each hole (or spot where there is no hole punched) in this card represents a bit of information.

A **bit** (short for "BInary digiT") is a single on/off value. Only these two values are possible, though the two values may go by different names, such as true/false, or 1/0. There are many ways in which a bit can be implemented. Here are some ways that bits are implemented:

* A mechanical electrical switch (like a light switch.)
* Voltage on a wire.
* A light bulb being on or off.
* The state of a single transistor.
* The magnetic charge on a tiny part of the surface of a disk.
* The presence or absence of a hole punched in a card.
* A tiny part of the light-reflecting surface of a CD.
* Part of a radio signal.

Computers do all of their processing in terms of bits - any piece of information a computer stores or manipulates is stored as a sequence of these on/off values. For different purposes, a computer may use any of the mechanisms listed above (or many others) to represent those bits.

    :answer_a: A single on/off value.
    :answer_b: A value of "one."

    What is a **bit**?
 
.. mchoice:: questionbits_2 
    :answer_a: The method used to implement a bit does not affect the information it represents
    :answer_b: A bit may be implemented as a small part of a magnetic disk.
    :answer_c: Copying a bit from one medium to another does not affect the information it represents.
    :answer_d: A bit is always implemented as something electrical.
    :correct: d
    :feedback_a: A light bulb that is "Off" represents the same thing as an "Off" represented by a hole that is not punched
    :feedback_b: This is how hard drives store information
    :feedback_c: Computers do this all the time - turn an electrical signal in a circuit into a magnetic field on a disk. Or turn a hole into a punch card into an electrical signal
    :feedback_d:
