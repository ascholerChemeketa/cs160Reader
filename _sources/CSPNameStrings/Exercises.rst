    Using the variables given, modify the print statement to print
    ``"A car travelling at 70 mph takes 2.0 hours to go 140 miles."``  
    Make sure to print the variables, not the values you know they contain.
    If we changed ``milesPerHour`` and ``distanceTravelled`` your program should still print a correct message.

    Write code below to get at least 3 values from the user using the ``input`` function and output
    a mad lib (which will use the input to tell a silly story).

    This problem is not automatically checked. Make sure you are using variables to build your output
    and that the story uses the values you type in as input. Try giving different inputs and make sure
    that the story uses them.
