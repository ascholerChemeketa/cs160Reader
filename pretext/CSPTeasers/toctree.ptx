    <title>An introduction to programming</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            This chapter contains some teasers of the kinds of things you will learn to do with
            programming. The goal is to expose you to what is possible, not to learn any particular
            skills. So don't worry about all of the details of how each program works - you aren't
            expected to learn that all at once. Instead, focus on the big ideas. Later chapters will
            help you master what is going on in each of the programs.
