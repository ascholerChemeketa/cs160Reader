        <title>Philosophy</title>

        <p>This text is intended for students who haven&#8217;t programmed before and for students
            who may not be intending on a career in software development. It uses the programming
            language <term>Python</term>, which is considered one of the easier programming
            languages to learn, but is powerful enough to be used by companies like Google and
            Pixar.</p>
        <p>Learning to write code is a little like learning to write English. You can&#8217;t hope
            to sit down and write something if you do not understand the language. You have to start
            by learning to read the language. In reading, you learn not just how the language works,
            but how skilled writers use language to communicate. However, progressing from reader to
            writer requires additional work. It is one thing to read a well-crafted essay, another
            thing entirely to write one. The same is true of programming. You need to learn how to
            read and understand code to be able to write it. But then, you need to practice writing
            code to learn the art of building new programs.</p>
        <p>Thus, this text uses the following sequence to introduce programming as a whole and
            individual topics:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Rather than having you write lots of code right away, we will ask you to <em>
                        read</em> a lot of code <em>examples</em>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We ask you to <em>use</em> what you are learning from the examples in some
                        simple <em>practice</em> exercises. These exercises are meant to be short
                        and easy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Eventually you will build to writing your own interesting programs.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>This first chapter introduces the approach used in this book and offers some quick
            &#8220;teasers&#8221; of things we&#8217;ll be doing later. <term>Don&#8217;t worry if
            you don&#8217;t understand the code (programs - instructions that a computer can
            understand) that you see in this chapter</term>. We&#8217;ll go through things much more
            slowly in the next few chapters.</p>
