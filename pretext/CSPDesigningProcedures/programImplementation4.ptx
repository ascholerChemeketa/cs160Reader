  <title>Program Implementation - 4</title>
  <p>We are finally ready to add a roof! This version of the program has added a <c>drawRoof</c>, but the procedure is missing
    its body. Try writing the body of <c>drawRoof</c>.</p>
  <p>Tips:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If you make the roof a 30, 120, 30 triangle, the two upper sides should be 173 long.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make sure to use <c>begin_fill</c> and <c>end_fill</c> in your procedure. Without them, the triangle will not get filled in.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You donâ€™t actually have to draw the bottom edge of the roof since there is already a line there.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Notice we have commented out the tests for the doors and windows. There is no need to run that code while you are
    working on the roof.</p>
