  <p>This chapter included the following concepts from computing.</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>Bottom-up implementation</term> - The process of building a program by first building small low-level,
          simple procedures and then using those to help build more complex procedures.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Precondition</term> - Something that the code in a procedure assumes to be true. The caller of a
          procedure is responsible for making sure the Precondition is true before calling it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Top-down design</term> - The process of breaking a complex task into smaller problems that are easier
          to solve.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
