        <title>Program Implementation - Final</title>
        <p>Now that we have all the building blocks, lets give a name to the lines of code that do the
            work of drawing the house.</p>
        <p>The instructions to <c>goto</c> particular locations and <c>drawWall</c>, <c>drawDoor</c>, etc&#8230; have
            all been moved into a procedure to make it more clear what the overall goal of the instructions
            is. But, we have not given that procedure a name. Chose a name for the procedure that draws
            the whole house and replace the <c>_____________</c> below with your name. Make sure to replace
            it in both the procedure definition and the procedure call.</p>
