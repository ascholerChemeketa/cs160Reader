  <title>Merge Sort Efficiency</title>
  <p>So how efficient is Merge Sort? Well, for starters, remember that merging <term>n</term> items takes <m>O(n)</m>
    work. In other words, merging 5 items takes ~5 units of work, merging 20 items, takes ~20 units of work, etc<ellipsis/>
    Now let’s do a rough analysis of how long it takes to do a merge sort on a list of length 1024.</p>
  <p>All the hard work takes place as we merge the lists back together:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The first merge for a list of 1024 things would be to merge 1024 single items into 512 lists of length two.
          Each merge would take ~2 units of work since there are two items in the new lists. 512 lists times 2 units of
          work = ~1024 units of work.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The next level would be to merge those 512 lists of size 2 into 256 lists of size 4. Each merge in that level
          would take ~4 units of work. 256 lists times 4 units of work = 1024 units of work again.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The table below shows this and the pattern for the rest of the level:</p>

  <tabular halign="center">
    <row header="yes">
      <cell>Level</cell>
      <cell>Description</cell>
      <cell>Number of Lists</cell>
      <cell>Size of Each List</cell>
      <cell>Amount of Work</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>1</cell>
      <cell><line>Merge 1024 lists of size 1</line><line>
      into 512 lists of size 2</line></cell>
      <cell>512</cell>
      <cell>2</cell>
      <cell>512 <times/> 2 = <em>1024</em></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>2</cell>
      <cell><line>Merge 512 lists of size 2</line><line>
      into 256 lists of size 4</line></cell>
      <cell>256</cell>
      <cell>4</cell>
      <cell>256 <times/> 4 = <em>1024</em></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>3</cell>
      <cell><line>Merge 256 lists of size 4</line><line>
      into 128 lists of size 8</line></cell>
      <cell>128</cell>
      <cell>8</cell>
      <cell>128 <times/> 8 = <em>1024</em></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><ellipsis/></cell>
      <cell><ellipsis/></cell>
      <cell><ellipsis/></cell>
      <cell><ellipsis/></cell>
      <cell><ellipsis/></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>???</cell>
      <cell><line>Merge 2 lists of size 512</line><line>
      into 1 lists of size 11024</line></cell>
      <cell>1</cell>
      <cell>1024</cell>
      <cell>1 <times/> 1024 = <em>1024</em></cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>

  <p>Note that at each level the work is ~1024 units of time - exactly the number of items in the full list. Thus we can
    say each level takes <m>O(n)</m> work.</p>
  <p>The only other thing we need to figure out is <q>how many levels are required?</q> The table above skips a
    few steps in the middle. We could go back and add them in - starting with 1024 items the levels would look like:</p>
  <program language="none">
    <input>
1024 → 512 → 256 → 128 → 64 → 32 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
</input>
  </program>
  <p>That is 10 levels of merging to group 1024 single items into one list of 1024.</p>

    <title>Wolfram Alpha</title>
    <p>You can use <url href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/" visual="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha website</url>
      to calculate log base 2 by typing something like <q>log2(1024)</q>. Try it below:</p>
      <raw format="html" xml:space="preserve">
          <div style="text-align: center;"><form action="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/"><input type="text" id="input" style="width:60%" name="i"></input>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button></form></div>
        </raw>
  </sidebar>
  <p>As we saw with binary search, that progression - dividing by 2 repeatedly until we reach 1 - can also be determined
    by the mathematical function <m>log_2(n)</m>. <m>log_2(1024) = 10</m>. Using that, we could calculate the number of
    levels of merges required to do a Merge Sort on a list of 100,000 items: <m>log_2(100,000) \times 16.61</m>. (Since
    we can’t do 16.61 merges levels, we would call that 17.)</p>
  <p>The formula also allows us to write a general formula for the overall work required for a Merge Sort. Starting
    with:</p>
  <p>
    <md><mrow>\textrm{total work} = \textrm{work per level} \times \textrm{number of levels}</mrow></md>
  </p>
  <p>We know that sorting <term>n</term> items will require <m>log_2(n)</m> levels and each level will take <term>n</term>
    work:</p>
  <p>
    <md><mrow>\textrm{total work} = \textrm{n work} \times log_2(n) \textrm{ levels}</mrow></md>
  </p>
  <p>Or:</p>
  <p>
    <md><mrow>\textrm{total work} = n \cdot log_2(n)</mrow></md>
  </p>
  <p>Merge Sort requires <m>O(n \cdot log_2(n))</m> work to sort a list of size <term>n</term>.</p>
