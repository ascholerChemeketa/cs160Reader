  <title>Efficiency Testing</title>
  <p>We are going to try running some real procedures so we can understand their efficiency. To understand the
    efficiency of a procedure, we need to run it with different input sizes and time how long it takes for each of the
    inputs. Then, we look for a pattern in the results. All of the procedures will exhibit one of these three patterns:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If the procedure takes about the same time no matter what the input is, that procedure is <term>Constant</term>
          or <m>O(1)</m>.</p>
        <p>Note that every time you run a procedure, it will not take the exact same amount of time - even for the same
          size input. There is some variability based on what else the computer is doing as it runs the program. <term>
          Constant</term> does not mean it always takes exactly the same time. It means that it always takes <em>about
          the same amount of time</em>, regardless of the input size.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If each time we increase the input size by 2, it produces a similar increase in the time the procedure takes,
          it is <term>Linear</term> or <m>O(n)</m>.</p>
        <p>For example, we try input size 4 and that takes 0.8 seconds; we try input size 6 and that takes 1.12 seconds;
          we try input size 8 and that takes 1.39 seconds. Each time we increase the input by 2, the time increases by
          ~0.3 seconds. This is linear growth.</p>
        <p>Again, you should not expect the pattern to be perfect. Going up by 0.32 one time, 0.27 the next, and maybe
          0.29 the next would be considered linear growth. Those values are all about 0.3 and are not increasing in a
          consistent pattern.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If each time we increase the input by size 2, the time increases by more and more and more, we are looking at
          a <term>Quadratic</term> or <m>O(n^2)</m> algorithm. (To be precise, if you calculate the increase from one
          step to the next, it should increase at a fairly steady rate).</p>
        <p>An example of this would be if an input size 4 takes 0.8 seconds; an input size 6 takes 1.4 seconds; an input
          size of 8 takes 2.61 seconds; and an input size of 10 takes 4.39 seconds. The first increase in size increased
          the time by 0.8 seconds. The next increase the time by 1.21 seconds. The third increased the time by 1.78
          seconds. The rate of increase keeps increasing (in this case, it goes up by about 0.6 seconds each time), that
          is quadratic growth.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <transition />
  <p>The actual procedures we will test are in the program at the bottom of the page. There is a lot of code, you do not
    have to worry about most of it. What is important is that it defines <c>procedureA</c>, <c>procedureB</c>, <c>procedureC</c>, <c>procedureD</c>, and <c>procedureE</c>.
    Each procedure takes a number as its input. At the top of the program is the procedure <c>doTest</c>. To run a particular
    procedure, we just need to change line 6 to say something like <c>procedureA(6)</c> to run procedureA with an input of 6 - or <c>procedureC(10)</c>
    to run procedureC with an input of size 10.</p>
  <p>When you run a procedure, it will make a drawing and print out how long the drawing took to make.</p>
  <p>For example<ellipsis/> The code below is already set up to run procedureA with an input size of 4 -<c>procedureA(4)</c> on line 6. I
    ran it and got a time of ~0.97 seconds. Then, to test the same procedure with an input of size 6, I change line 6 to <c>procedureA(6)</c>.
    I run that and get a time of ~1.63 seconds. I do the same for input sizes of 8 and 10 (changing line 6 and then
    running the program again.) Here is what I get:</p>

    <tabular>

      <row header="yes">
        <cell> Input </cell>
        <cell> 4 </cell>
        <cell> 6 </cell>
        <cell> 8 </cell>
        <cell> 10 </cell>
      </row>

      <row>
        <cell> Time </cell>
        <cell> 0.97 </cell>
        <cell> 1.63 </cell>
        <cell> 2.22 </cell>
        <cell> 2.77 </cell>
      </row>

    </tabular>
  <p>Looking at that pattern, I can see that each time I increase the Input size by 2, procedureA takes approximately
    ~0.6 more seconds. That steady growth means procedureA is <term>Linear</term> or <term>O(n)</term>.</p>
