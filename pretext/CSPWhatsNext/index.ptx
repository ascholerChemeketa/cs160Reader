    <title>Extending Your Programming Skills</title>
    <p>Are you interested in extending your knowledge of Python or using it to solve problems of your own design? Here are
      some resources to check out.</p>
    <subsection xml:id="csp-whats-next_full-python-on-the-web">
      <title>Full Python On The Web</title>
      <p>There are many websites where you can write and test Python programs. However, unlike this book, which supports a limited set
        of Python libraries, these sites usually support all the common Python libraries. (This book is more limited
        because it turns your Python code into Javascript so it can run directly in the web browser. These sites
        run your code on a server using <q>real</q> Python.)</p>
      <p>Here are two options:
        <ul>
          <li><url href="https://replit.com/languages/python3" visual="https://replit.com/languages/python3">replit</url>
          </li>
          <li><url href="https://www.online-python.com/" visual="https://www.online-python.com/">online-python</url>

      <title>Python On Your Computer</title>
      <p><url href="https://thonny.org/" visual="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</url> is a super simple editor for writing
        Python to run on your computer. It will automatically install a copy of Python, so you can install <term>Thonny</term>
        and start writing code without worrying about anything else.</p>
      <p><url href="https://codewith.mu/en/" visual="https://codewith.mu/en/">Mu</url> is another good choice for getting
        started writing Python to run on your computer.</p>
      <p>You can also install <title_reference>Python &lt;https://www.python.org/&gt;</title_reference> and use any text
        editor you like to write code. This route is only recommended if you already are used to using text editors and
        working from the command prompt.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="csp-whats-next_more-python">
      <title>More Python</title>
      <p><url href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html"
          visual="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html">*How To Think Like A Computer
        Scientist</url> is a free ebook that covers basic concepts in more depth than this book and extends to much more
        advanced programming topics. If you want to get serious about Python programming, check it out.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="csp-whats-next_applications">
      <title>Applications</title>
      <p>There are Python libraries for making games (PyGame, Panda3D), for making applications that have Graphical User
        Interfaces (GUIs) - buttons, windows, etc<ellipsis/> (tkinter, Kivy), for doing data science on large data collections
        (Pandas, NumPy), and just about anything else you can think of. Use google to look for <q>Python
        YOUR_INTEREST</q> and see what you can find.</p>
