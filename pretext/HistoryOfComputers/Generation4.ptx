    <p>The Intel 4004: the first commercial microprocessor consisted of 2,300 transistors</p>
  </sidebar>
  <p>The next major advance in fundamental computer technology was the <term>microprocessor</term>. These devices are
    integrated circuits that combine thousands of transistors that perform the logic needed to run a computer into one
    chip. In 1971, Intel released the 4004 microprocessor and the <term>Fourth Generation</term> of computers had begun.</p>
  <p>In the late 1970s computers like the Altair, Apple, and Commodore were the first computers widely sold to
    individual users. In 1981 IBM released the first PC and the personal computer revolution had begun. Although the
    machines we use are millions of times more powerful than those early personal computers they are direct descendants
    of these machines.</p>
