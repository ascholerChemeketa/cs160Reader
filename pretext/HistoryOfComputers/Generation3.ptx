    <p>Integrated circuits combine multiple transistors into one compact package.</p>
  </sidebar>
  <p>Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments invented the <term>integrated circuit</term> in 1958. Integrated circuits (ICs)
    combine many transistors into a single package; compared to individual transistors, they consume less power and can
    be packed in much tighter. Early ICs consisted of only a handful of transistors, but now days integrated circuits
    can be made with billions of transistors in the space of a fingernail.</p>


  <p>The ability to pack more computational power into less space heralded a new
    generation of computers. Computers of the <term>Third Generation</term>, built with integrated circuits, were even
    smaller more powerful and cheaper than the Second Generation. Instead of building all the logic for a computer in
    terms of individual transistors, integrated circuits allowed designers to work with more abstract logical building
    blocks. A new class of computer, the minicomputer, was created. Though still large by today&#8217;s standards,
    minicomputers were significantly less expensive than the large mainframe computers previously available and brought
    computers into even more businesses.</p>
  <p>This generation also saw the introduction of many features we now take for granted. Keyboards and displays were
    developed during this period to facilitate real-time interaction with computers - prior machines had to be fed a job
    and left to run it with little in the way of feedback provided until the job was complete. <xref
      ref="operating-systems_operating-systems" text="custom">operating systems</xref> were developed that allowed multiple programs and
    users to interact with the machine at once.</p>

      <p>The PDP machines of the third generation were enormously influential - much early computer science was done on
        these machines</p>
