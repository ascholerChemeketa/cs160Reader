  <title>Chapter Summary</title>
  <p>This chapter included the following concepts from computing.</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>Boolean Expression</term> - A Boolean expression is one that is either true or
          false. This is also called a <term>logical expression</term>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Condition</term> - A condition is something that is either true or false. This is
          also called a <term>Boolean expression</term> or a <term>logical expression</term>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Conditional Execution</term> - Conditional execution means that one or more
          statements are executed only when a condition (<term>logical expression</term>) is true.
          This is also called a <term>conditional</term>. The statements that are executed when the
          condition is true are called the <term>body</term>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Flowchart</term> - A flowchart is a diagram that shows the execution paths for a
          program. The conditionals are shown as diamonds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Logical Expression</term> - A logical expression is one that is either true or
          false, like <c>x == 3</c> which will return true if x is equal to 3. This is also called a <term>Boolean
          expression</term>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <title>Summary of Python Keywords and Functions</title>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><term>Else</term> - The keyword <c>else</c> is used to execute one or more statements in a
            block following the <c>else</c> when the condition in the <c>if</c> part of the statement is
            false. An <c>else</c> must always have an <c>if</c> statement before it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><term>Elif</term> - The keyword <c>elif</c> is used when you want to have a conditional
            with 3 or more possible options. Add as many <c>elif</c> statements as you need after an <c>if</c>
            and before a <c>else</c>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><term>If</term> - The Python keyword <c>if</c> is used to start a condition. It is
            followed by a Boolean expression and then has one or more statements in the body of the
            loop which are executed only if the Boolean expression is true.</p>
        </li>
