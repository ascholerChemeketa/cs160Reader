  <p>Suppose for a moment that you were asked to perform a task and were given the following list of instructions to
    perform:</p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>0001 0011 0011 1011</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1101 0111 0001 1001</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>1111 0001 1101 1111</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>0000 1100 0101 1101</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>0001 0011 0011 1011</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>These instructions have no real meaning to you, but they are exactly the kind of instructions that a computer
    expects. It only knows how to deal with 0s and 1s, so all of its instructions must be written in binary format. A
    processor’s control unit has a format it expects each such instruction to be in: typically an instruction will
    be a set length, say 16, 32, or 64 bits and the first few bits will specify what kind of instruction it is. These
    first few bits, known as the <term>opcode</term> (operation code), say what general task is to be done - something
    like <q>store a number</q> or <q>add two numbers</q>. The rest of the instruction will contain <term>
    operands</term>, the extra information needed to understand the instruction - things like where to store the number
    or which two numbers to add.</p>
  <p>The figure below shows how an imaginary computer might interpret an instruction. The first 4 bits are the opcode -
    in this case, we are assuming 0001 means <q>add two values</q>. The next 6 bits specify the memory address of
    the first number we are adding and the last 6 bits specify the memory address of the second number.</p>

  <p>Computers usually support only a small number of machine code instructions; a few dozen to a few hundred very
    simple instructions like <q>add two numbers</q> or <q>store a value to memory</q>. The list of
    available instructions and the format for specifying them make up a <term>machine language</term>. Machine languages
    were the first programming languages - the earliest electronically programmable computers had to be programmed by
    feeding in a program as a list of 0s and 1s that specified what the computer was to do. (Before that the program had
    to be set physically with switches or patch cords.)</p>
  <important>
    <p>Because these are the only instructions a computer actually can understand and perform, at some point, every
      program a computer runs must be converted to machine instructions.</p>
  </important>
  <p>You can probably see the difficulties of working in machine language. While it might be very appropriate for a
    computer, it is extremely confusing for a computer programmer. They are also restricted to very low-level commands.
    There is no way to say something like <q>open a connection to google.com</q> or <q>draw this image on the
    screen</q> in a machine language - instead you would have to break those tasks down into much lower-level
    commands that would accomplish your goal.</p>
