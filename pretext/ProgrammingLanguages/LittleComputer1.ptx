  <title>The Little Computer</title>
  <p>The Little Computer (sometimes called the Little Man Computer) is designed to explore how machine level languages
    work. At a low level, all computers do is move around pieces of data and do basic math and logic operations on that
    data.</p>
  <p>The Little Computer has memory for 100 pieces of information and a simple CPU. The CPU has three <xref
      ref="../ComputerArchitecture/Processor2#registers" />: a program counter, an instruction register, and an
    accumulator. The CPU supports a very basic set of operations: it can get input and output, it can store data to
    memory and load it from memory, it can do addition and subtraction, and it can branch (or jump) to a different
    instruction if certain conditions are met.</p>
  <p>Rather than use binary to encode instructions, it uses decimal numbers to represent data and instructions. This
    makes it a little easier for a human to see what is going on. But other than that, it is a relatively accurate, if
    very simple, simulation of a computer. A real processor will have more registers to work with and will support
    dozens of instructions instead of the handful that the Little Computer does. But for the most part, everything they
    do is just as simple: they load/store data from memory, they do basic math and logic operations on data, and they
    use branches to make decisions and repeat operations. Whatever code a programmer writes in a <xref
      ref="HighLevelLanguages#high-level-languages" /> like javascript or C++ gets turned into these basic <xref
      ref="MachineLanguages#machine-languages" />.</p>
  <p>This video introduces how the Little Computer works:</p>

  <p>You can run the Little Computer be run in a web page using the link below. The interface looks a little different
    than the video, but it functions the same way. It will launch with the program shown in the video. To try out a
    different program, simply edit the values that are in memory, and then press the reset button.</p>

  <note>
    <p>As you experiment with the little computer, notice that the memory is storing both the instructions and the data.
      An &#8220;instruction&#8221; is simply some data in memory that the computer tries to decode as a machine
      instruction and run.</p>
