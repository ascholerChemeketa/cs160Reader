        <p xml:id="sql-intro_index-0">The goal of a programming language like Python is to be <term>general-purpose</term>. A general-purpose
            programming language is one that is designed to enable the programmer to write any program
            that they like. Python can be used to make a videogame, a program to analyze data in
            a spreadsheet, a web server, or just about anything else you can imagine.</p>
        
        
        <p xml:id="sql-intro_index-1">The problem with a language being general is that its <term>syntax</term>, or rules, have to support
            all kinds of different tasks. It can&#8217;t be optimized to focus on one particular job. When
            there is a critical job that we have to write lots of code for, we might want to use a
            language that was designed specifically for that job. A programming language that is
            designed to solve one kind of problem is often referred to as a <term>domain-specific language</term>.</p>
        
        
        <p xml:id="sql-intro_index-2">One such domain-specific language is <term>SQL</term>, which stands for <term>Structured Query Language</term>. It
            is a programming language that is used to get, store, and change information in a database.
            You can&#8217;t really use it to program a videogame, or to make a web server, but if your task
            involves working with a database, SQL makes it easier to write code to get a job done. The syntax
            of SQL, because it only focuses on working with databases, has been optimized for that particular
            job.</p>
        <p>This chapter will introduce the basics of using SQL. You will not be going into depth learning
            how to program with SQL, just developing a basic understanding of how we use it to work with
            data in databases.</p>
