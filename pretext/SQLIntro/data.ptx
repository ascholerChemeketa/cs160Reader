        <title>Tables of Records</title>
        
        
        <p>Say you are conducting research about bike sharing for an
            internship in Washington D.C. You are given the Capital Bike Sharing dataset,
            contains information on Washington D.C.&#8217;s bike share program for 2011. The database
            has hundreds of thousands of records about every ride that anyone took and you would
            like to look for patterns in the data to understand questions like: &#8220;How long is
            the average ride?&#8221; and &#8220;Where is the most popular place to start a ride?&#8221;</p>
        <p>In a database, the data is arranged in <term>tables</term> like the one shown below. This <c>trip_data</c>
            table has all of the information about individual trips that were made. Each
            row in a table is a <term>record</term> - here, each record is an individual trip someone made.</p>

        <p>The columns are the pieces of data associated with each record. Here is a description of
            the columns available in the <c>trip_data</c>:</p>
