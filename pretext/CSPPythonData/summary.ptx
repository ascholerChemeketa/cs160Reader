  <title>Chapter Concept Summary</title>
  <p>This chapter included the following concepts from computing.</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>Text Files</term> - Files in which data is stored as ASCII text. Thus even numbers
          are stored as strings. These files are easy for humans to work with, but less efficient
          for computers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Binary Files</term> - Files in which data is stored in its raw binary form. This is
          more efficient for computers to work with, but very difficult for humans to work with
          unless they use special tools.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <title>Summary of Python Keywords and Functions</title>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><term>Close</term> - The <c>close</c> procedure closes a file after you are done processing
            it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><term>Open</term> - The <c>open</c> procedure opens the passed file for either reading or
            writing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><term>Split</term> - The <c>split</c> function can be called on a string to break it up at a
            specified character into a list of strings. For example, if <c>message = "Nora,Jones,15"</c> then <c>message.split(",")</c> would
            return <c>['Nora', 'Jones', '15']</c>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
