  <title>Data and Python</title>
  <p>Although SQL gives us powerful tools for querying data that is stored in a database, programmers often need to work
    with data in other languages. If our data is coming from somewhere like a file or a website, it is not in a
    database, so there is nothing to issue SQL instructions to. Or maybe we need to manipulate the data using some
    complex logic - we want to find telephone numbers in a wide range of formats like <q>5031231234</q> or
    <q>503 123-1234</q> or <q>(503) 123 1234</q> and turn them into something standard like
    <q>503-123-1234</q>. SQL excels at basic filtering and aggregation, but it can be difficult to express more
    complex algorithms in it.</p>
  <p>For situations like these, programmers will use Python or some other general-purpose programming language to work
    with their data. In this chapter, we will look at how that is done.</p>
