  <title>Data and Python</title>
  <p>Although SQL gives us powerful tools for querying data that is stored in a database, programmers often need to work
    with data in other languages. If our data is coming from somewhere like a file or a website, it is not in a
    database, so there is nothing to issue SQL instructions to. Or maybe we need to manipulate the data using some
    complex logic - we want to find telephone numbers in a wide range of formats like &#8220;5031231234&#8221; or
    &#8220;503 123-1234&#8221; or &#8220;(503) 123 1234&#8221; and turn them into something standard like
    &#8220;503-123-1234&#8221;. SQL excels at basic filtering and aggregation, but it can be difficult to express more
    complex algorithms in it.</p>
  <p>For situations like these, programmers will use Python or some other general-purpose programming language to work
    with their data. In this chapter, we will look at how that is done.</p>
