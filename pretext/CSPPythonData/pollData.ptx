  <title>Our first data set: Air pollution in the United States</title>
  <p>This first data set that we&#8217;re going to explore is from <em>The Guardian</em> newspaper&#8217;s data blog. It
    is a record of the air pollution in various cities. According to the World Health Organization, 2.5-micrometer
    pollution is particularly deadly because it more easily gets <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"
      visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates">deep into our lungs</url>. To give a sense of how dangerous
    this kind of pollution is, an annual mean amount of just 5 &#181;g/m3 (microgram per cubic meter of air) was linked
    with a 13% increased risk of heart attacks.</p>
  <p>We will use just the US data. It is in a large text file that looks like this:</p>

  <datafile filename="uspoll2.txt" label="uspoll2.txt" xml:id="csp-python-data_poll-data-file2">
    <pre>
      asdf
      asdf
      qwer
    </pre>
  </datafile>


  <program xml:id="csppythondata_readdata1b" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      # Open the file for reading. The reference we will use to work with it will be inFile
      inFile = open("uspoll.txt")

      # get all the lines of data
      data = inFile.read().splitlines()

      # Print out the full array of data
      print(data)
      print("-------------------------------------------")

      # close the file
      inFile.close()

      # Now process all the data by looping through the lines
      for line in data:
          print(line)
    </input>
  </program>


  <datafile filename="uspoll.txt" label="uspoll.txt" xml:id="csp-python-data_poll-data-file">
    <pre source="CSP/datafiles/uspoll.txt"/>
  </datafile>
  
  <p>There are three columns separated by colon (&#8216;:&#8217;) characters:</p>
    <list xml:id="csp-python-data_poll-data-file-description"> 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The city and state, separated by a comma.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The annual mean amounts of particulate pollution that&#8217;s 10 micrometers in diameter, measured in terms
            of micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) of air. This is abbreviated as PM10.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The annual mean amounts of particulate pollution that&#8217;s 2.5 micrometers in diameter (even smaller),
            measured in the same micrograms per cubic meter of air. This is abbreviated as PM2.5.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </list>
