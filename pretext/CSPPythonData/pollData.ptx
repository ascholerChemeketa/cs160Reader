  <title>Our first data set: Air pollution in the United States</title>
  <p>This first data set that we&#8217;re going to explore is from <em>The Guardian</em> newspaper&#8217;s data blog. It
    is a record of the air pollution in various cities. According to the World Health Organization, 2.5-micrometer
    pollution is particularly deadly because it more easily gets <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"
      visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates">deep into our lungs</url>. To give a sense of how dangerous
    this kind of pollution is, an annual mean amount of just 5 &#181;g/m3 (microgram per cubic meter of air) was linked
    with a 13% increased risk of heart attacks.</p>
  <p>We will use just the US data. It is in a large text file that looks like this:</p>

  <datafile filename="uspoll.txt" label="uspoll.txt">
    <pre source="CSP/datafiles/uspoll.txt"/>
  </datafile>

  <p>There are three columns separated by colon (&#8216;:&#8217;) characters:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The city and state, separated by a comma.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The annual mean amounts of particulate pollution that&#8217;s 10 micrometers in diameter, measured in terms
          of micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) of air. This is abbreviated as PM10.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The annual mean amounts of particulate pollution that&#8217;s 2.5 micrometers in diameter (even smaller),
          measured in the same micrograms per cubic meter of air. This is abbreviated as PM2.5.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
