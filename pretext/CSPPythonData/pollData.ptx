  <title>Our first data set: Air pollution in the United States</title>
  <p>This first data set that we’re going to explore is from <em>The Guardian</em> newspaper’s data
    blog. It is a record of the air pollution in various cities. According to the World Health
    Organization, 2.5-micrometer pollution is particularly deadly because it more easily gets <url
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates"
      visual="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates">deep into our lungs</url>. To give a sense
    of how dangerous this kind of pollution is, an annual mean amount of just 5 µg/m3 (microgram per
    cubic meter of air) was linked with a 13% increased risk of heart attacks.</p>
  <p>We will use just the US data. It is in a large text file that looks like this:</p>

  <datafile filename="uspoll.txt" label="uspoll.txt" xml:id="csp-python-data_poll-data-file">
    <pre source="CSP/datafiles/uspoll.txt" />
  </datafile>

  <p>There are three columns separated by colon (':') characters:</p>
  <list xml:id="csp-python-data_poll-data-file-description">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The city and state, separated by a comma.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The annual mean amount of particulate pollution that is 10 micrometers in diameter,
          measured in terms of micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) of air. This is abbreviated as
          PM10.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The annual mean amount of particulate pollution that is 2.5 micrometers in diameter (even
          smaller), measured in the same micrograms per cubic meter of air. This is abbreviated as
          PM2.5.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </list>
