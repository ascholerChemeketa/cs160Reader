  <title>Most Populated and Least Populated States</title>
  <p>If we want to dig into patterns in pollution, there are many hypotheses we might want to test:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Maybe bigger states have more <em>stuff</em> and that leads to more pollution?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Maybe smaller states have more things crammed into a smaller place, and that leads to more pollution?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Maybe richer states have more industry, and that leads to more pollution?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Maybe poorer states are home to more polluting industries like coal-powered factories and that leads to more
          pollution?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Maybe more populous states have more people (so more cars and houses<ellipsis/>) and that leads to more
          pollution?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>To try to answer these questions, we need to calculate the average pollution for a specific state.</p>
  <p>We will also need some data about which states are large and small and which are richer and poorer. The top three
    largest states in population are:</p>

  <p>The three largest states in land area are Alaska, Texas, and California. The three smallest are Connecticut,
    Delaware, and Rhode Island.</p>
  <p>The three <em>richest</em> states (by per capita income) are Maryland, Alaska, and New Jersey. The three poorest
    are Arkansas, West Virginia, and Mississippi.</p>
