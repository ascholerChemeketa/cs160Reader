  <title>What’s the largest pollution values?</title>
  <p>Now that we have figured out how to process the data in the file, we can get to work on answering questions about
    it. One of the interesting questions to explore might be, <q>Which city has the worst pollution at the PM2.5
    level?</q> The program below figures that out. It uses the maximum value pattern to do this - <c>max25</c> will be
    used to store the highest PM2.5 value we have seen. We also need to remember the name of the city that value was
    from. We will use <c>maxCity</c> to do this and update it every time we find a new <c>max25</c>. It isn’t easy to
    initialize these to match the first record, so we will start <c>max25</c> with a tiny value we know will get replaced by
    the first record.</p>
  <p>There is one extra wrinkle we need to worry about. Recall that the data in a text file is stored as ASCII text. So
    a PM2.5 value in the file would be <c>"12"</c> instead of the number <c>12</c>. That is a problem because when you
    compare strings, they are compared alphabetically. <c>"B"</c> is greater than <c>"Apple"</c> because B comes after A. By the
    same logic, the string <c>"2"</c> is greater than the string <c>"12"</c> because 2 is greater than 1. If we convert the
    strings to numbers, things will work as expected - <c>2</c> is smaller than <c>12</c>. So we must use <c>int()</c> to
    convert the PM2.5 values to integer numbers.</p>
