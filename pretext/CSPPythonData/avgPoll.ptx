  <title>What&#8217;s the average pollution?</title>

 
  <p>This time, we would like to get the average pollution level. To do that, we need to take every PM2.5 value and add
    them all together. As we do this, we need to keep a count of how many values we have seen, so we can compute an
    average.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>This program will calculate the average PM2.5 pollution level in the US data. Arrange the blocks in the right
        order and indent them correctly. You will use all of them.</p>

  <p>Now let&#8217;s do the same thing for the PM10 values. This program is mostly done. There are a few lines that need
    to still be written, they are all marked with a <c>TODO</c> comment. Finish up the program so you can find the average
    PM10 level.</p>

  <program xml:id="csppythondata_avgpoll2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
inFile = open("uspoll.txt")
data = inFile.read().splitlines()
inFile.close()

# TODO - add a variable to store the total PM10

count = 0  # Will store the number of records

for line in data:
    values = line.split(":")

    # TODO - get the current PM10 value and turn it into an int

    # TODO - add curPM10 value to the total variable

    count = count + 1   #add one to the number of records

average = # TODO - calculate average
print("Average PM 10 value is", average)
