  <title>Chapter Summary</title>
  <p>This chapter included the following concepts from computing.</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>Abstraction</term> - Abstractions in code are things that allow us to focus on the big picture - like <c>drawSquare</c>
          instead of the details required to actually do the job.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Argument</term> - An actual parameter is a value passed into a procedure or function when it is called.
          In <c>forward(50)</c> the actual parameter is 50. This is also called an <term>actual parameter</term>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Call</term> - You can call or run a procedure or function by using the name of the procedure or
          function followed by values to pass into the procedure or function. An example is <c>forward(50)</c>. This is also known
          as <term>executing</term> or <term>running</term> a procedure or function.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Define</term> - You can define a new procedure or function in Python using the <c>def</c> keyword.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Execute</term> - Execute means to <term>run</term> or <term>call</term> a procedure or function.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Formal Parameter</term> - A formal parameter is named input in the definition of a procedure or
          function. This is also called a <term>parameter</term>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Function</term> - A function is a named set of instructions that <em>returns a result</em>. An example
          is the <c>abs(num)</c> which returns the absolute value of the num.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Library</term> - A library is a named group of related procedures and functions. An example is the
          Turtle library.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Parameter</term> - A parameter is input to a procedure or function that is named when you define the
          procedure or function. It will be assigned a value when you call the procedure or function. This is also
          called a <term>formal parameter</term>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Procedure</term> - A procedure is a named set of instructions that <em>does not return a result</em>,
          but can cause something to happen like the turtle <c>forward(amount)</c> procedure.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Run</term> - To run a procedure or function use the name of the procedure or function in your program.
          This is also known as <term>calling</term> or <term>executing</term> a procedure or function.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
