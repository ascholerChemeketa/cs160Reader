  <title>Making a MadLib story</title>
  <p>You might have done MadLib stories when you were a kid. You provide some pieces of information, like a name of a
    friend, a verb, and a favorite game (for example), and those pieces of information get plugged into a story. Since
    you don&#8217;t know the story beforehand, you&#8217;re surprised at what happens to your friend in the story.</p>

  <program xml:id="cspnamestrings_madlib1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
firstName = "Pat"
lastName = "Smith"
gender = "girl"
address = "65 Elm Street"
verb = "eat"
start = "Once there was a " + gender + " named " + firstName + "."
next1 = "A good " + gender + " living at " + address + "."
next2 = "One day, a wicked witch came to the " + lastName + " house."
next3 = "The wicked witch was planning to " + verb + " " + firstName + "!"
ending = "But " + firstName + " was smart and avoided the wicked witch."
print(start)
print(next1)
print(next2)
print (next3)
print(ending)
        </input>
  </program>

  <exercise label="cspnamestrings_madlib2">
    <statement>

      <p>Now you want to add more to the story. You want it to say: &#8220;Pat called the police who took the witch
        away.&#8221; Adding which of these lines to the end of the program will make that happen? (Hint: It is okay to <em>
        try</em> each one!)</p>

    </statement>
    <choices>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>realEnding = firstName + " called the police who took the witch away."</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>This would only work if you also put <code>print(realEnding)</code> after this line.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>print(firstName + " called the police who took the witch away.")</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>This is a good way to do this since the line that is printed will have the correct first name. You could
            also make a string named <code>realEnding</code> first, and then print it.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>print("Pat called the police who took the witch away.")</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>This <i>would</i> work. But if you changed the <code>firstName</code> variable, this line would not change.
            A different answer is better.</p>

  <p><term>You should really do this:</term> Run this program to see what gets generated, then change some of the
    variables to make different stories. Try different names, different verbs.</p>

  <note>
    <p>When you print a string (a sequence of characters in a pair of single, double, or triple quotes) in Python it
      will print the exact characters in the string. When you print a variable it will print the value of that variable.</p>
