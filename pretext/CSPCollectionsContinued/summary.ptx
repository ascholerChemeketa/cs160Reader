  <title>Chapter Concept Summary</title>
  <p>This chapter included the following concepts from computing.</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>Index Based List Iteration</term> - To modify items in a look as we iterate through them, we need to
          use a counting loop where we iterate through the indexes of all of the items in the list. Given the index, we
          can access items to read them or to modify them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>List Slice</term> - We can copy part of a list by making a slice using the syntax <c>list[startIndex:endIndex]</c> The slice
          will be a list that contains all the item from <c>startIndex</c> up to but not including <c>endIndex</c>. We can leave <c>endIndex</c>
          blank to select until the end of the list. The original list will not be modified.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
