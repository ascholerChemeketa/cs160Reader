  <title>Slicing a List</title>
  <p>Now that we know how to iterate through parts of a list, we could use that technique to copy just part of a list.
    Say we have a list with the 12 months, and from it we want to copy out just the summer months (June-August). We know
    those are months 6-8 (human numbering), which means in computer counting, they will be index 5-7. That means we need
    to use <c>range(5, 8, 1)</c> to loop through them. As we access each one, we will append it to the <c>summerMonths</c> list that starts out
    empty.</p>

  <program xml:id="cspcollectionscontinued_slices1" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]

# Empty list we will build up
summerMonths = []

# loop though every other index starting from 0
for i in range(5, 8, 1):
    summerMonths.append( months[i] )

print(summerMonths)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>But, rather than do that work ourselves, there is syntax in Python for asking for part of a list. Part of a list is
    known as a <term>slice</term>. We ask for a slice in a similar way to asking for a single item. To get a single item
    from a list, say the item at index 4, we say <c>list[4]</c>. To ask for a slice of <c>list</c> we would say something like: <c>list[4:10]</c>
    which says &#8220;I want a copy of items number 4 through 9&#8221;. Notice that the second value, which is the
    stopping point, is not included in the slice.</p>
  <p>That means a much easier way to get a list of the summer months would be:</p>

  <program xml:id="cspcollectionscontinued_slices2" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]

# Use a slice to get summerMonths
summerMonths = months[5:8]

print(summerMonths)
    </input>
  </program>
  <note>
    <p>Remember that the slice always stops just before the second index given. <c>[5:8]</c> only slices indexes 5-7.</p>
  </note>
  <p>There are some handy shortcuts we can use when specifying a slice. If you don&#8217;t give a second index, like <c>[5:]</c>,
    it means &#8220;to the end of the list&#8221;. If you use a negative value, it is counted from the end of the list. <c>[-3:-1]</c>
    means &#8220;the slice from the third to the last item up to but not including the last item&#8221;. <c>[-2:]</c> would
    mean &#8220;the last two items&#8221;.</p>

  <program xml:id="cspcollectionscontinued_slices3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]

summerMonths = months[5:8]
print(summerMonths)

lastSix = months[6:]
print(lastSix)

lastThree = months[-3:]
print(lastThree)
        </input>
  </program>

  <exercise label="cspcollectionscontinued_slices4">
    <statement>

      <p>Check all the valid ways to specify the slice that includes &#8220;Sep&#8221;, &#8220;Oct&#8221;,
        &#8220;Nov&#8221;, &#8220;Dec&#8221;</p>

          <p>Index 9 is for the 10th item, which is "Oct".</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

        <feedback>
          <p>Correct.</p>

      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>[-4:]</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>[-4:-1]</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>-1 as the stop value will stop before the last item.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>
    </choices>

  </exercise>
  <warning>
    <p>If the end index you give in the slice is less than the start one, like <c>[5:2]</c>, you will always get an empty
      list as a result. Same if you specify a starting index past the end of the list by doing something like <c>months[15:]</c>.</p>
