        <title>Functions and Composition</title>
        <p>So far we have focused on writing <term>procedures</term> - problem solving recipes that do part of
            a job and return no answer. Now we will shift our attention to <term>functions</term> - problem
            solving recipes that are designed to calculate some value and return it to the code that
            calls the function so we can do more work with the result.</p>
        <p>In the sample below, we can see the importance of returning results from functions so
            that we can string together a number of steps. Line 3 calls the <c>input</c> function to get
            a string like <c>"4"</c> from the user and store it as <c>sideAText</c>.
            Then on line 5 we use the <c>float</c> function to turn that string  into a numeric value
            <c>4.0</c> and store that in <c>sideA</c>. We then use <c>math.pow</c> to raise that value to the second
            power and store the result as <c>aSquared</c>. <c>aSquared</c> gets used as part of the input
            to the <c>math.sqrt</c> function which produces our final answer <c>sideC</c> which gets passed to the
            <c>print</c> function.</p>

    <program xml:id="cspnamefunctions_functionscomposition1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
import math

sideAText = input("Enter length of side A")
sideBText = input("Enter length of side B")
sideA = float(sideAText)
sideB = float(sideBText)

aSquared = math.pow(sideA, 2)
bSquared = math.pow(sideB, 2)
sideC = math.sqrt(aSquared + bSquared)

print("The length of side C is", sideC)
        </input>
    </program>
        <p>The fact that every function (other than <c>print</c>) returns a value is what allows to chain this
            work together and use the result of one function as the input to the next function. We take the
            returned value (the output of the function) and store it into a variable so we can pass it on
            to the next as input.</p>
        <p>Note that just like with procedures, some functions like <c>input</c> are standalone and are called
            on their own. Other functions are part of a library or object and must be called with dot notation
            like <c>math.pow</c>.</p>
        
        
        <subsection xml:id="csp-name-functions_function-composition">
            <title>Function Composition</title>
            <p>We can more directly specify to use the result of calling one function as the input to another
                function via <term>functional composition</term>. That is where we put one function call inside of another -
                like how this version of the same program does <c>float(input("Enter length of side A"))</c>.</p>

    <program xml:id="cspnamefunctions_functionscomposition2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
import math

sideA = float( input("Enter length of side A") )
sideB = float( input("Enter length of side B") )

sideC = math.sqrt( math.pow(sideA, 2) + math.pow(sideB, 2) )

print("The length of side C is", sideC)
        </input>
    </program>
            <p>Like when doing math, we always do work inside of parentheses before worrying about the work
                outside of them. In this case, that means we start with the <c>"Enter length of side A"</c>. It is
                just a string, so there is nothing special to do with it other than use it as the argument to
                <c>input()</c>. Then the <c>input</c> function runs and does its job to get input from the user. It
                returns a string with whatever the user typed. Recall that the mental model you should use forget
                function calls is that they are replaced by the value they return. So
                <c>input("Enter length of side A")</c> ends up just becoming something like <c>"4"</c>. That value
                is what gets used as the argument for <c>float()</c>.</p>
            <p>When <c>sqrt(pow(sideA, 2) + pow(sideB, 2))</c> is evaluated, we have to start with the inner functions
                and get answers for <c>pow(sideA, 2)</c> and <c>pow(sideA, 2)</c>. Then we can add those answer to get
                one number. That one number ends up being the argument for <c>sqrt</c> which takes the square root of
                it and returns the answer.</p>
            <warning>
                <p>Writing code using functional composition in this style can make programs look shorter, but
                    it tends to make them harder to debug. In the first version of this program, we could add a
                    <c>print</c> call after any line to see what value a function produced and check if it is
                    correct. If something isn&#8217;t working right in a line of code like
                    <c>sqrt( pow(sideA, 2) + pow(sideB, 2) )</c>, it can be hard to figure out what part is not
                    working as expected - the <c>pow</c>, the <c>+</c>, or the <c>sqrt</c>.</p>
