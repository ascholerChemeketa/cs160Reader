    <title>Math Library Functions</title>
    <p>Occaisionally while programming, we may need to do more complex mathematical work than the basic math operators
        allow for.</p>

    <p>The <url href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html"
            visual="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html">Python math library</url> has a wide assortment of
        functions and predefined variables we can use to do so.</p>
    <p>For instance, say we want to figure out the radius of a circle with an area of 100 sq. inches. The formula to
        calculate this is <m>radius = \sqrt{\frac{area}{\pi}}</m>. The math library has a <c>math.sqrt(number)</c> function that will
        give us the square root of whatever value we give. It also has a built-in value for pi (<m>{\pi}</m>) that can
        be accessed as <c>math.pi</c>.</p>
    <p>To make use of these, we need to first <c>import math</c> to make the math library available to use in our program. We then
        can access things like <c>math.sqrt</c> and <c>math.pi</c>.</p>

    <listing xml:id="cspnamenumbers_mathlibrary_listing1">
        <program xml:id="cspnamenumbers_mathlibrary1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
            <input>
# make the math library functions and variables available
import math

area = 100
radius = math.sqrt(area / math.pi)
print("Radius is", radius)
print("The value we used for pi was", math.pi)
        </input>
        </program>
    </listing>
    <p>An important detail to notice is that <c>math.sqrt</c> <term>returns</term> an answer to us that we must do something with.
        Just like the line of code <c>x * 2</c> doesnâ€™t do anything unless we store the result, (something like <c>y = x * 2</c>),
        writing <c>math.sqrt(area / math.pi)</c> would do the math, but then throw away the answer. We need to store the answer into a variable
        if we want to do anything with it.</p>

    <exercise label="cspnamenumbers_mathlibrary2">
        <statement>

            <p>If you delete the line that says <c>import math</c> from <xref ref="cspnamenumbers_mathlibrary_listing1" />, what
                happens when you run the code?</p>

    <p>You do not need to worry about memorizing these, we will introduce them again in later chapters as needed. But
        here are some more examples of math library functions.</p>
