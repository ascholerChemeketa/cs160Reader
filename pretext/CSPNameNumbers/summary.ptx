        <title>Chapter Summary</title>
        <p>Chapter 2 included the following concepts from computing.</p>
        
        
        <p><ul>
            <li>
                <p><term>Arithmetic Expression</term> - An arithmetic expression contains a mathematical
                    operator like <c>-</c> for subtraction or <c>*</c> for multiplication.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><term>Assignment</term> -  Assignment means setting a variable&#8217;s value.  For example, <c>x = 5</c> assigns
                    the value of 5 to a variable called <c>x</c>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><term>Assignment Dyslexia</term> - Assignment Dyslexia is putting the variable name on the right and the
                    value on the left as in <c>5 = x</c>.  This is not a legal statement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><term>Camel-Case</term> - Camel-case is when the first letter of each additional word is uppercased when
                    you create variable names that have several words in them like <c>firstName</c>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><term>Integer Division</term> - Integer division is when you divide one integer by another. In some
                    languages this will only give you an integer result, but in Python 3 it returns a decimal value.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><term>Mixed-Case</term> - Mixed-case means using upper and lower case letters in a variable name like
                    <c>"HiThere"</c>.  One way to do this is to use camel-case.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><term>Modulo</term> - The modulo, or remainder operator, <c>%</c>, returns the remainder after you divide
                    one value by another.  For example the remainder of <c>3 % 2</c> is 1 since 2 goes into 3 one
                    time with a remainder of 1.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><term>Tracing</term> - Tracing a program means keeping track of the variables in the program and how
                    their values change as the statements are executed.  We used a Code Lens tool to do this
                    in this chapter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><term>Variable</term> -  A variable is a name associated with computer memory that can hold a value and
                    that value can change or vary. One example of a variable is the score in a game.</p>
            </li>
        </ul></p>
