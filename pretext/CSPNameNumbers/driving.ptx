    <title>Driving from Chicago to Dallas</title>

    <p>As an example, imagine that you were planning to drive from Chicago to Dallas.
        If you know how many miles-per-gallon your car gets, and how many miles it is, you can estimate the number of
        gallons it will take.</p>
    <p>Use the <em>CodeLens</em> below to trace through what it would look like for a computer to execute this program:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Press <term>Next</term> to run the next instruction.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Press <term>Prev</term> to go back one instruction.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <program interactive="codelens" language="python" xml:id="csp-name-numbers_driving-from-chicago-to-dallas-1" >
        <input>
distance = 924.7
mpg = 35.5
gallons = distance / mpg
    </input>
    </program> 

    <p>Now, if we know the average cost of a gallon of gas, we can figure out the cost
        of the trip from Chicago to Dallas in your car.</p>
    <warning>
        <p>Notice that in the code below that we are using <term>camel case</term> variable names like <c>costPerGallon</c> and <c>costTrip</c>.
            When using this style, you have to be careful about capitalization - <c>costperGallon</c> is a different name than <c>costPerGallon</c>.
            Try changing just the first copy of <c>costPerGallon</c> below to <c>costpergallon</c> and then run the code to see what happens.</p>
    </warning>

    <program interactive="codelens" language="python" xml:id="csp-name-numbers_driving-from-chicago-to-dallas-2">
        <input>
distance = 924.7
mpg = 35.5
gallons = distance / mpg
costPerGallon = 3.65
costTrip = gallons * costPerGallon
    </input>
    </program>

    <p>What we&#8217;re doing above is <term>tracing</term> a program. Normally, we <term>
        run</term> a program &#8211; tell the computer to execute each step of the program as fast as possible. When we
        do that, we don&#8217;t see individual variable values, as we can above. However, we can check values (including
        the values for variables) by printing them.</p>
    <p>The function <c>print</c> can take an <em>input</em> (a variable name inside of parentheses) whose value will be
        displayed. The <c>print</c> function can also print a <term>string</term> (like <c>"Cost to get from Chicago to Dallas"</c>) which is a sequence of
        characters inside a pair of double quotes as seen in line 8. It will print the exact contents of the string.
        This is useful for explaining the values that you are printing.</p>
    <p>You can also print multiple things on one line by putting them all inside the parentheses after <c>print</c>,
        separated by commas. You can see this on line 12 in the program below.</p>

    <program interactive="activecode" language="python" xml:id="csp-name-numbers_driving-from-chicago-to-dallas-3">
        <input>
distance = 924.7
mpg = 35.5
gallons = distance / mpg
costPerGallon = 3.65
costTrip = gallons * costPerGallon

#Use print to print out a description of costTrip, then the value
print("Cost to get from Chicago to Dallas")
print(costTrip)

#Print the description and value on the same line
print("Cost to get from Chicago to Dallas", costTrip)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>Try editing the program above and running it to answer the questions below:</p>

        <statement>

            <p>If the cost per gallon drops to $3.45, can we drive from Chicago to Dallas for less than $90 in gas?</p>
