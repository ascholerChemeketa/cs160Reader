        <title>The Need for Lists</title>
        
        
        <p xml:id="csp-collections-intro_index-0">Up until now, most of the data we have worked with we have thought about as single values:
            The number 34.2, or the word &#8220;Hello&#8221;, or a Turtle, or an Image. We have used multiple pieces of
            data in programs - we might work with a first and last name, or an hours_worked and pay_rate -
            but those pieces of data were usually given separate names.</p>
        <p>Often times however, we want to work with a group of values that are all related. Say I want to
            work with the scores a student has gotten on a series of eight quizzes. If I name each score
            separately (<c>quiz1</c>, <c>quiz2</c>, &#8230;) it will be hard to write code that does something like
            find the highest score. I would end up having to do like this:</p>
        <pre>highest_score = quiz1
if quiz2 &gt; highest_score:
    highest_score = quiz2
if quiz3 &gt; highest_score:
    highest_score = quiz3
if quiz4 &gt; highest_score:
    highest_score = quiz4
...</pre>
        <p>Remember that in programming, we want to avoid writing the same code over and over. And that
            is what this is&#8230; I am doing the same steps over and over, just with the different variables.
            What I need is a way to lump all the quizzes together so I can talk about them all at once
            and more easily write code to work with all the individual scores.</p>
