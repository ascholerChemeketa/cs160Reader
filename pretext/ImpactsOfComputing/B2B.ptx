  <title>Blown To Bits</title>
  <p>The book <url href="https://www.bitsbook.com/" visual="https://www.bitsbook.com/">Blown to Bits</url> does a
    wonderful job of laying out many of the effects of computing technology. These paragraphs from the book lay out its
    thesis and also elegantly describe our the concerns we should all have:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <paragraphs>
    <title>Good and Ill, Promise and Peril</title>
    <p>The digital explosion has thrown a lot of things up for grabs, and we all have a stake in who does the grabbing.
      The way the technology is offered to us, the way we use it, and the consequences of the vast dissemination of
      digital information are matters not in the hands of technology experts alone. Governments and corporations and
      universities and other social institutions have a say. And ordinary citizens, to whom these institutions are
      accountable, can influence their decisions. Important choices are made every year, in government offices and
      legislatures, in town meetings and police stations, in the corporate offices of banks and insurance companies, in
      the purchasing departments of chain stores and pharmacies. We can all help raise the level of discourse and
      understanding. We can all help ensure that technical decisions are made in a context of ethical standards.</p>
    <p>We offer two basic morals. First, information technology is inherently neither good nor bad; it can be used for
      good or ill, to free us or to shackle us. Second, new technologies bring social change, and change comes with both
      risks and opportunities. All of us, and all of our public agencies and private institutions, have a say in whether
      technology will be used for good or ill and whether we will fall prey to its risks or prosper from the
      opportunities it creates.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
    <title>Technology Is Neither Good nor Bad</title>
    <p>Any technology can be used for good or ill; digital technologies, in particular, can be simultaneously good and
      bad. Nuclear reactions create electric power and weapons of mass destruction. These two uses share a common core
      but are otherwise quite distinct. Not so in the world after the digital explosion.</p>
    <p>The same encryption technology that makes it possible for you to email your friends with confidence that no
      eavesdropper will be able to decipher your message also makes it possible for terrorists to plan their attacks
      undiscovered. The same Internet technology that facilitates the widespread distribution of educational works to
      impoverished students in remote locations also enables massive copyright infringement. The photomanipulation tools
      that enhance your snapshots are used by child pornographers to escape prosecution.</p>
    <p>The same technologies can be used to monitor individuals, to track their behaviors, and to control what
      information they receive. Search engines need not return unbiased results. Many users of web browsers do not
      realize that the sites they visit archive their actions. There is probably a record of exactly what you have been
      accessing and when, as you browse a clothing or book store catalog, a site selling pharmaceuticals, or a service
      offering advice on contraception or drug overdose. There are vast opportunities to use this information for
      invasive but relatively benign purposes, such as marketing, and also for more questionable purposes, such as
      blacklisting and blackmail.</p>
    <p>The key to managing the ethical and moral consequences of technology while nourishing economic growth is to
      regulate the use of technology without banning or restricting its creation.</p>
    <p>Few regulations mandate disclosure that the information is being collected or restrict the use to which the data
      can be put. The USA PATRIOT Act and other federal laws give government agencies sweeping authority to sift through
      mostly innocent data looking for signs of <q>suspicious activity</q> by potential terrorists<mdash/>and to
      notice lesser transgressions in the process. Although the World Wide Web reaches into millions of households, the
      rules and regulations governing it are not much better than those of a lawless frontier town of the Old West.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
    <title>New Technologies Bring Both Risks and Opportunities</title>
    <p>The same large storage media that enable anyone to analyze millions of baseball statistics also allow anyone with
      access to confidential information to jeopardize its security. Access to aerial maps via the Internet makes it
      possible for criminals to plan burglaries of upscale houses, but technologically sophisticated police know that
      records of such queries can also be used to solve crimes.</p>
    <p>Social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter have made their founders quite wealthy and have given birth
      to many thousands of new friendships, marriages, and other ventures. But interconnectivity has unexpected side
      effects, too. A woman in England discovered that her fianc√© was married when Facebook suggested his wife as
      someone she might want as a friend. And in 2019 a Massachusetts college student committed suicide by jumping from
      the fourth floor of a parking garage, having received some 47,000 text messages, many allegedly abusive, from his
      girlfriend in the previous two months. She was charged with involuntary manslaughter<mdash/>the same crime she
      might have been charged with had she instead struck him with her car while driving and texting. In a nation deeply
      committed to free expression as a legal right, which Internet evils should be crimes, and which are just wrong?</p>
    <p>Vast data networks have made it possible to move work to where the people are, not people to the work. The
      results are enormous business opportunities for entrepreneurs who take advantage of these technologies and new
      enterprises around the globe, and also the other side of the coin: jobs lost to outsourcing. The difference every
      one of us can make, to our workplace or to another institution, can be to ask a question at the right time about
      the risks of some new technological innovation<mdash/>or to point out the possibility of doing something in the
      near future that a few years ago would have been utterly impossible.</p>
