        <title>Analyzing Impacts</title>
        <p>In this class, you will be asked on several assignments to find one or
            more articles about some aspect of computing and use them to describe
            it as well as its positive and negative impacts.  You will do this by
            answering a series of four questions. They are listed below as questions
            A&#8211;D.  Below each question is a series of prompts to consider. You do
            not necessarily need to address each prompt&#8212;they are simply guides of
            things you should consider while answering that question.  You should
            generally be able to answer each question in a few sentences.</p>

            <title>Choosing a Technology</title>
            <p>You will be given a list of general themes to explore, like &#8220;machine
                learning&#8221; or &#8220;software bugs&#8221;.  However, those themes are too
                broad to analyze in this format&#8212;you are expected to choose a single,
                concrete algorithm or technology, such as &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s chatbot that
                learned to be racist&#8221; or &#8220;the Ariane 5 rocket that exploded&#8221;.</p>
            <p>As part of choosing a technology, find one or more sources that tell you
                enough information about it to answer questions A&#8211;D. Include a list
                of your sources (with links when possible) along with your answers.</p>
