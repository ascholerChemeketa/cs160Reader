        <title>Example: Street Maps</title>
        <p>This example analyzes the impacts of street map applications on society.</p>
        <transition/>
        <p><term>A. According to your sources, what is the purpose/use of the technology?</term></p>
        <p>Street map software, such as the original <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapQuest" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapQuest">MapQuest</url>, the dominant
            <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps">Google Maps</url>,
            and the open-content <url href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap" visual="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</url>, allow users
            to browse maps on the web and plan driving routes. They often have other
            features, such as searching for businesses in a particular geographical
            area, planning trips with multiple stops, and predicting traffic.</p>
        <p><term>B. According to your sources, how does the technology use computation?</term></p>
        <p>The main data used is a spatial description of the map itself, including
            not only the coordinates of significant landmarks and turns in the
            road, but often detailed descriptions of shapes.  That information
            is rendered into map tiles that can be presented to a user. Most
            street map software also has some integration with top-down satellite
            imagery to present a different view. Google Maps offers <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View">Street View</url>, which allows users
            to view some locations as though standing nearby, using VR stitching to
            assemble hypothetical views out of photography gathered by Google.</p>
        <p><term>C. How is this use of computation beneficial and who benefits?</term></p>
        <p>Access to detailed, accurate street maps that can be accessed on the web
            and shared has many benefits. Software predictions about driving times are
            more precise than estimating distances on a paper map, and can incorporate
            live information about traffic and construction. Street View is a
            useful feature for people who navigate visually to be able to recognize
            landmarks along their route, and has been leveraged to make unexpected new
            applications including <url href="https://www.geoguessr.com/" visual="https://www.geoguessr.com/">games</url>. Businesses
            can leverage their appearance on the map to attract customers. People
            can share locations and directions for a variety of meetings.</p>
        <p><term>D. How is this use of computation harmful and who is harmed?</term></p>
        <p>There is also harm to both people who use the
            map and people whose locations appear on the
            map. Street View suffers from many <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View_privacy_concerns" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View_privacy_concerns">privacy concerns</url>.
            Coverage of street map software is incomplete, and some
            locations do not appear or&#8212;worse&#8212;appear wrongly, so that
            people relying on the software are <url href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091207222555/http://www.generalwarren.com/directions/directions.html" visual="https://web.archive.org/web/20091207222555/http://www.generalwarren.com/directions/directions.html">led away from their destinations</url>.
            Cartography is complex, and by relying on software, people lose the
            skills of making and reading maps.</p>
