  <title>Chapter Summary</title>
  <p>This chapter included the following concepts from computing.</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>Boolean Expression</term> - A Boolean expression is one that is either true or false. This is also
          called a <term>logical expression</term>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Condition</term> - A condition is something that is either true or false. This is also called a <term>Boolean
          expression</term> or a <term>logical expression</term>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Conditional Execution</term> - Conditional execution means that one or more statements are executed
          only when a condition (<term>logical expression</term>) is true. This is also called a <term>conditional</term>.
          The statements that are executed when the condition is true are called the <term>body</term>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Decision</term> - A decision is a choice between at least two choices.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Input</term> - The <c>input</c> function returns a value that the user enters.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Logical Expression</term> - A logical expression is one that is either true or false, like <c>x == 3</c>.
          This is also called a <term>Boolean expression</term>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <title>Summary of Python Keywords and Functions</title>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><term>And</term> - The keyword <c>and</c> is used to join two logical expressions and then both of the logical
            expressions must be true for the joined expression to be true.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><term>Else</term> - The keyword <c>else</c> is used to execute one or more statements in a block following the <c>else</c>
            when the condition in the <c>if</c> part of the statement is false. An <c>else</c> must always have an <c>if</c>
            statement before it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><term>Elif</term> - The keyword <c>elif</c> is used when you want to have a conditional with 3 or more
            possibile options. Add as many <c>elif</c> statements as you need after an <c>if</c> and before a <c>else</c>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><term>If</term> - The Python keyword <c>if</c> is used to start a condition. It is followed by a Boolean
            expression and then has one or more statements in the body of the loop that are executed only if the Boolean
            expression is true.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><term>Not</term> - The keyword <c>not</c> is used to negate a <term>logical expression</term>. If the original
            expression is true the negated expression is false and if the original expression is false the negated
            expression is true.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><term>Str</term> - The function <c>str</c> turns a number into a string so that it can be appended to a
            string.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
