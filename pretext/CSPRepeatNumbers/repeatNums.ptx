  <title>Repeating Calculations</title>
  <p>While calculating an approximate square root with Newton&#8217;s method, we often want to use the formula <m>1/2((N/G)
    + G)</m> multiple times to keep improving our approximation. Earlier, we defined a procedure to make it easier to
    reuse the formula. But if we want to apply the formula a whole bunch of times in a row, a loop makes sense. Try
    running this program with the Codelens:</p>

  <program xml:id="csprepeatnumbers_repeatnums1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
# Number to find the square root of
number = 110
# Our first (obviously incorrect guess)
guess = number

for iteration in range(5):
    guess = 1/2 * ((number / guess) + guess)

print("The square root of ", number, "is approximately:")
print(guess)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Each time we pass through the loop, we update the guess and it becomes a little closer to the truest value for the
    square root we can represent (we can never write a perfect representation of the answer as a decimal, so we have to
    settle for being correct to a significant number of digits). The for loop is initially set to repeat 4 times, which
    gets us pretty close to the true value of the square root - 10.48808848170152.</p>

  <exercise label="csprepeatnumbers_repeatnums2">
    <statement>
      <p>Modify the loop to repeat more times. What is the minimum number of repetitions you need to get an answer that
        is as accurate as possible? (One that displays as 10.48808848170152) <var />
      </p>
    </statement>
    <setup>
      <var>
        <condition string="^\s*^8$\s*$">
          <feedback>
            <p>Correct!</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
        <condition string="^\s*^9$\s*$">
          <feedback>
            <p>That is more repetitions than needed</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
        <condition string="^\s*\d{2}\s*$">
          <feedback>
            <p>That is more repetitions than needed</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
        <condition string="^\s*\d\s*$">
          <feedback>
            <p>The answer is still changing after that many repetitions</p>
          </feedback> 
        </condition>
        <condition string="^\s*.*\s*$">
          <feedback>
            <p>Make sure to give your answer as a number</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition> 
      </var>
    </setup>
  </exercise> 
  <p>The number of repetitions needed to get the most accurate possible square root for a given number is not always the
    same. If you change <c>number</c> to 2, it would only take 5 iterations of the loop to find the best possible guess for
    the square root. Without experimenting, we don&#8217;t really know how many repetitions are needed to get the best
    possible answer. Currently our program says something like <em>&#8220;repeat this calculation 5 times&#8221;</em>.
    What we would like to say is something more like <em>&#8220;repeat this calculation while it keeps producing a new
    value&#8221;</em>.</p>
