  <title>While Loops - While vs Until</title>
  <p>While loops are most useful when we don&#8217;t have a set list of items to repeat over or any time we can more
    easily describe <em>&#8220;here is the sign we should stop&#8221;</em> rather than <em>&#8220;here are all the
    values we need to do this for&#8221;</em>. We saw one example of that in the program that asked for user input. But
    there are many other situations in which a <c>while</c> is the easiest way to make a loop.</p>
  <p>Say we want to convert a decimal number to binary using the division method. The <xref
      ref="../DataRepresentation/BinaryConversions2#binary-conversion-division" /> says that we need to keep dividing by
    2 <term>until</term> the quotient is 0. That is a description of when to stop, which means a while loop is what we
    will use to write the algorithm. However, when we write a while loop, we need to describe the situation that means <em>&#8220;keep
    doing the loop&#8221;</em>. If we want to <em>&#8220;stop when the quotient is 0&#8221;</em> that is the same as <em>&#8220;keep
    going while the quotient is NOT 0.&#8221;</em> Try running this version of the algorithm in codelens mode:</p>

  <program xml:id="csprepeatnumbers_whilegeneral1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
number = 11
binary = ""     # this will hold our answer

# != means "is not equal to"
while number != 0:
    # % gives remainder
    remainder = number % 2

    # turn the remainder into a string to add it to the front of binary
    binary = str(remainder) + binary

    # use // to do whole number division
    number = number // 2

print(binary)
        </input>
  </program>
  <warning>
    <p>The condition for a while loop always describes a test that tells us to keep going - <em>&#8220;Keep doing this
      while&#8221;</em>. A common mistake is to write <term>until</term> logic - a test that says when to stop.</p>
    <p>If the natural way to say what you want involved <term>until</term>, like &#8220;Keep going until the user enters
      0&#8221;, turn it into <term>while</term> by reversing it - &#8220;Keep going while the user has NOT entered
      0&#8221;.</p>

  <exercise label="csprepeatnumbers_whilegeneral2">
    <statement>

      <p>We have a program that is going to keep adding interest to a bank account until the <c>balance</c> reaches $10,000 or
        more. Which would be the correct logic to complete <c>while ___________:</c>?</p>

    </statement>
    <choices>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>while balance &gt;= 10000</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>That is the "until" logic - the situation to stop in. We want the condition under which to continue.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>while balance &lt; 10000</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>Correct. The sign to keep going is that the balance is less than 10000</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>while balance == 10000</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>We need to write the logic that describes when to continue looping. That would only loop if we already had
            10000.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>while balance != 10000</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>That is close. We need to loop until we hit 10000. But if we do not hit 10000 exactly, that loop would not
            stop.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>
    </choices>

  </exercise>
  <p>Thus a while loop allows us to write a program to use Newton&#8217;s method to calculate a square root and say
    &#8220;keep repeating the formula until the answer stays the same&#8221;. This will produce the most accurate answer
    we can produce, without having to worry in advance about how many repetitions we should ask for. Try running this
    program and changing <c>number</c> to smaller and larger values. Notice how the number of repetitions is different for
    different numbers.</p>

  <program xml:id="csprepeatnumbers_whilegeneral3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
number = 110
guess = number              # guess will store our most recent guess
last_guess = 0              # The guess before this one
while guess != last_guess:  # != means "not eqaul to"
    last_guess = guess      # Update our last_guess to match current one
    #Now calculate a new guess
    guess = 1/2 * ((number / guess) + guess)
    print("New guess is:", guess)
        </input>
  </program>
