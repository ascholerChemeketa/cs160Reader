  <title>Information Systems</title>

  <p>In some ways <term>Information Systems</term> attacks the same basic problems as Information Technology in that it
    is focused on making computer technology work for people and organizations.</p>
  <p>However, while IT is more concerned with the technology itself, Information Systems focuses more on
    business-related issues. They are interested in questions like: &#8220;What information does the enterprise
    need?&#8221;, &#8220;How is that information generated?&#8221;, &#8220;Is it delivered to the people who need it? Is
    it presented to them in ways that permit them to use it readily?&#8221;</p>
  <p>Information Systems degrees generally have a blend of courses in technology, business, and communications. IS
    professionals must understand both technical and organizational factors so they can serve as a bridge between the
    technical and management groups in an organization.</p>

    <title>Education</title>
    <p>Because IS jobs tend to have significant business and management responsibilities, they are more likely to
      require a Bachelor&#8217;s degree than IT jobs.</p>
    <p>An Information Systems degree will combine technical knowledge and business knowledge in different degrees. Some
      IS programs have a more technical focus, with a core of technical skills like an IT professional. Other programs
      are much more business focused and have technical courses that don&#8217;t focus on developing practical skills,
      but instead focus on understanding how technologies are used so that the IS practitioner can manage people with
      more applied skills.</p>
