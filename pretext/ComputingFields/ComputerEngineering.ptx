  <p><term>Computer Engineers</term> research, design, develop and test computer chips, circuit boards, computer
    systems, and related equipment. They need to understand computer programming, as they are the ones who design the
    hardware that runs programs, but in general, their work is more focused on the hardware itself.</p>

    <title>Education</title>
    <p>To work in this field you need a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering. At some schools, instead of a
      separate Computer Engineering degree, students specialize in that field while earning a degree in Electrical
      Engineering. In addition to a deep knowledge of computer hardware and some programming knowledge, Computer
      Engineers need to do significant coursework in general engineering principles, physics, and math.</p>
