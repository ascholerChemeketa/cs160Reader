  <title>Computing Related Fields</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>The modern world of computation is too vast for anyone to master all the details. Not only has the design of
      computer hardware and software grown incredibly complex, but computing devices are being applied to solve problems
      in all aspects of modern life. A wide range of skills are required to build a computational device, develop
      software for it, decide how to make use of it and put it to use.</p>
    <p>The career/education options that directly relate to building and using computers can be broken down into the
      categories listed below. Although sometimes the borders between the fields are fuzzy, they serve as a good
      starting point for thinking about what kind of career might be of interest to someone who wants to go into a
      computation-related field.</p>
