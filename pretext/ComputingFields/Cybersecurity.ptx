  <title>Cybersecurity</title>

  <p><term>Cybersecurity</term> is a cross-disciplinary field that is concerned with preventing misuse of computational
    devices and data. It is a relatively new discipline that arose out of a realization that a system is only as secure
    as its weakest link - and thus keeping systems secure requires a comprehensive approach.</p>
  <p>While every technical professional should be concerned with security - developers should write secure code, network
    administrators should configure systems to be resilient to attack, etc<ellipsis/> - there is a need for individuals that
    can think about all of these potential issues and how they interact. These are cybersecurity professionals.</p>
  <p>Cybersecurity jobs from the technical (cryptography, network defense) to business and management (setting
    organization policy and training users). Even within the more technical jobs, there are a wide variety of
    specializations that may require advanced skills in programming, networking, system administration, or mathematics.</p>

    <title>Education</title>
    <p>Because Cybersecurity is a cross-disciplinary field, there are a variety of educational paths.</p>
    <p>Most Cybersecurity degrees focus on an IT skill set and then add specific advanced training in security-related
      topics. These programs exist both as two-year Associate’s degrees and as four-year Bachelor’s degrees.</p>
    <p>However, there are also IS-related jobs in Cybersecurity - management-focused roles that require more business
      knowledge and have less of a technical focus.</p>
    <p>And for Cybersecurity careers focusing on cryptography or advanced software-based security (malware analysis), a
      specialized background in CS or SE may be required. Some computer science programs offer tracks in cybersecurity
      that would be appropriate for these kinds of careers.</p>
