  <title>Computer Science</title>

  <p>Despite its name, much of <term>computer science</term> is not focused on the study of computers themselves.
    Instead, computer scientists are more concerned with understanding what problems can be solved with computation and
    how we can most efficiently and appropriately solve those problems with <em>algorithms</em>. (An algorithm is simply
    a step-by-step process for solving a problem.)</p>
  <p>Computer science tends to have a more theoretical focus than other computing disciplines. There is a core to the
    discipline that is closely related to ideas in math and logic. But the discipline also applies those theoretical
    tools to solve specific problems in areas from artificial intelligence, to graphics, to simulations, and many
    others.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Working as a software developer requires a Bachelor&#8217;s degree</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Working as a research scientist requires a graduate degree (Master&#8217;s or Ph.D.).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first year of study generally focuses on programming - the essential skill needed to solve problems using a
      computer. Courses in the following years tend to be more focused on the theory of why software and hardware work
      and how to build software.</p>
    <p>During their Jr and Sr years students usually can choose from classes to concentrate in a specific area
      (graphics, databases, artificial intelligence, computational biology, software development). For students who
      intend to become software developers, this is an important opportunity to take courses on software engineering and
      applied programming skills.</p>
    <p>Computer science students generally need a strong core of mathematics to support the theoretical parts of their
      CS coursework.</p>
