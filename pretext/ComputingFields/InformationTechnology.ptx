  <title>Information Technology</title>

  <p>Although the term <term>Information Technology</term> is sometimes used to describe any career involving computers,
    in the education world it has a more specific meaning - the skill set required to put computers to work in a
    business or other organization.</p>
  <p>IT professionals have the responsibility for installing and maintaining hardware and software products as well as
    integrating those products to meet organizational needs. They often work directly with non-technical users of
    complex technology to support those users and fix issues.</p>
  <p>A broad range of basic knowledge is required for an IT professional - they need to understand the basics of
    networking, programming, operating systems, computer hardware, and security. On top of this base layer of knowledge,
    many IT professionals develop more extensive expertise in a particular area such as database administration, system
    administration, or cybersecurity.</p>

    <title>Education</title>
    <p>Many entry-level jobs in IT are open to anyone with a certificate or two-year degree Associate’s. However,
      advanced jobs in specific areas often require advanced training or certification in that field. For example, to
      become a network administrator, you would need significant specialized knowledge in installing and configuring
      computer networks on top of the base level of knowledge expected from all IT professionals.</p>
    <p>Positions with more business or management responsibility may require a Bachelor’s degree.</p>
