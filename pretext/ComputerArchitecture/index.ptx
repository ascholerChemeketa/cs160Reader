  <title>Computer Architecture &amp; The Machine Cycle</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>Computers are built as a sequence of abstractions. Logical gates hide the messy details of electrical signals
      behind clean Boolean logic; logic gates in turn are used to construct circuits that perform functions like
      <q>add number <term>a</term> to <term>b</term></q> or <q>remember the last value input</q>; these
      circuit are in turn used to build the higher-level components that programs interact with - things like the
      processor, the main memory, and input and output devices.</p>
