        <title>Computer Architecture &amp; The Machine Cycle</title>
        <p>Computers are built as a sequence of abstractions. Logical gates hide the messy details of electrical signals behind clean Boolean logic; logic gates in turn are used to construct circuits that perform functions like &#8220;add number <term>a</term> to <term>b</term>&#8221; or &#8220;remember the last value input&#8221;; these circuit are in turn used to build the higher-level components that programs interact with - things like the processor, the main memory and input and output devices.</p>
