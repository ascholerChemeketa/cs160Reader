  <title>Computer Components</title>
  <p>You may already be familiar with the basic parts of a computer. Below is a picture of a desktop PC with some of the
    key components labeled:</p>

  <p>Not all of those components are critical: a laptop may use a trackpad instead of a mouse and lack room for
    expansion cards; a computer used as a network server may be installed without a monitor; a smartphone (which is
    really just a computer that can happen to make phone calls) does not come with an optical disk drive.</p>

  <p>But there are basic features that just about every modern computer does share. There is a processor, sometimes
    called the <term>CPU</term> (Central Processing Unit), that is responsible for running programs. There is a memory
    unit, generally referred to as the <term>RAM</term> (Random Access Memory) or <term>Main Memory</term>, that is
    responsible for storing the information the computer is working with and the programs it is running. Finally, there
    are <term>input</term> and <term>output</term> devices - the devices like keyboards and network interfaces that get
    information into the computer and printers and monitors that display the results of calculations. Finally, these
    devices need to talk to each other - they do so over electrical circuits called <term>busses</term>.</p>

  <p>This description leaves out many important parts of a computer - from relatively simple things like the cord or
    battery that supply electricity to complex devices like the storage (hard drives, DVD drives, flash drives) that
    provide long-term backup for main memory. But the basic functionality of the modern computer can be understood in
    terms of a processor, memory and input/output.</p>
