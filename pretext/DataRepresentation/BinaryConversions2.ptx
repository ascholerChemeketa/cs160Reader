  <title>Binary Conversions - Multiplication/Division Method</title>
  <p>The biggest issue with the &#8220;table method&#8221; shown on the previous page is that it is hard to translate
    into an algorithm that a machine could run. The multiplication/division methods shown on this page are much easier
    to express in simple terms as they rely on mathematics instead of looking at a table and making a decision.</p>
  <subsection xml:id="data-representation_decimal-to-binary-1">
    <title>Decimal to Binary</title>
    <p>The following algorithm converts a decimal number to a binary one:</p>
    <pre>
Step 1: Start with a blank <c>answer</c> and the <c>number</c> you are converting
Step 2: Divide your <c>number</c> by 2 to make a <c>quotient</c> and a <c>remainder</c>
Step 3: Place your <c>remainder</c> on the <term>left</term> side of your <c>answer</c>
Step 4: If your <c>quotient</c> is 0, you are done
        Otherwise, make the <c>quotient</c> your new <c>number</c> and go back to step 2
</pre>
    <p>Here is an example of running the algorithm to convert <m>{11}_{10}</m> to binary:</p>

    <p>So the decimal number 11 in binary is <m>{1011}_{2}</m>.</p>

    <title>Binary to Decimal</title>
    <p>To convert a binary number to its decimal value, we can use almost the same trick, but in reverse:</p>
    <program language="none">
      <input>
<p>Step 1: Start with the <em>number</em> your are converting and the <c>answer</c> of 0
Step 2: Multiply your <c>answer</c> by 2
Step 3: Remove the leftmost digit of <c>number</c> and add it to your <c>answer</c>
Step 4: If <c>number</c> has no more digits, you are done
        Otherwise, go back to step 2</p>
</input>
    </program>
    <p>If we follow this algorithm to convert <m>{1101}_{2}</m> into a decimal value, it would look like this:</p>
    <program language="none">
      <input>
<p>Step 1: <c>number</c> is 1101 and <c>answer</c> is 0
Step 2: <c>answer</c> is multiplied by 2 - it becomes 0
Step 3: Remove leftmost digit of <c>number</c> and add to <c>answer</c>
         <c>number</c> is now 101 and <c>answer</c> is 1
Step 4: <c>number</c> still has digits, go back to step 2
Step 2: <c>answer</c> is multiplied by 2 - it becomes 2
Step 3: Remove leftmost digit of <c>number</c> and add to <c>answer</c>
         <c>number</c> is now 01 and <c>answer</c> is 3
Step 4: <c>number</c> still has digits, go back to step 2
Step 2: <c>answer</c> is multiplied by 2 - it becomes 6
Step 3: Remove leftmost digit of <c>number</c> and add to <c>answer</c>
         <c>number</c> is now 1 and <c>answer</c> is 6
Step 4: <c>number</c> still has digits, go back to step 2
Step 2: <c>answer</c> is multiplied by 2 - it becomes 12
Step 3: Remove leftmost digit of <c>number</c> and add to <c>answer</c>
         <c>number</c> is now "" (empty) and <c>answer</c> is 13
Step 4: <c>number</c> is empty. We are done, the answer is 13.</p>

    <p>As mentioned earlier, the advantage of this algorithm is that it very easily converts into relatively simple
      computer code. To demonstrate that, the algorithm is implemented in Python in the <em>codelens</em> below. You DO
      NOT need to worry about exactly how the Python language works. You will notice that turning the English algorithm
      above into code requires some changes, but the code shown follows the same process described above. See the
      &#8220;tips&#8221; box below the code lens for help running the program.</p>


      <program interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
        for i in range(10):
            print(i)
        </input>
