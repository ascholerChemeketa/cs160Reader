  <title>Binary Conversions - Multiplication/Division Method</title>
  <p>The biggest issue with the <q>table method</q> shown on the previous page is that it is hard to translate
    into an algorithm that a machine could run. The multiplication/division methods shown on this page are much easier
    to express in simple terms as they rely on mathematics instead of looking at a table and making a decision.</p>
  <subsection xml:id="data-representation_decimal-to-binary-1">
    <title>Decimal to Binary</title>
    <p>The following algorithm converts a decimal number to a binary one:</p>
    <program>
      <input>
        Step 1: Start with a blank answer and the number you are converting
        Step 2: Divide your number by 2 to make a quotient and a remainder
        Step 3: Place your remainder on the left side of your answer
        Step 4: If your quotient is 0, you are done
                Otherwise, make the quotient your new number and go back to step 2
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>Here is an example of running the algorithm to convert <m>{11}_{10}</m> to binary:</p>

    <p>So the decimal number 11 in binary is <m>{1011}_{2}</m>.</p>

    <title>Binary to Decimal</title>
    <p>To convert a binary number to its decimal value, we can use almost the same trick, but in reverse:</p>
    <program language="none">
      <input>
Step 1: Start with the number your are converting and the answer of 0
Step 2: Multiply your answer by 2
Step 3: Remove the leftmost digit of number and add it to your answer
Step 4: If number has no more digits, you are done
        Otherwise, go back to step 2
</input>
    </program>
    <p>If we follow this algorithm to convert <m>{1101}_{2}</m> into a decimal value, it would look like this:</p>
    <program language="none">
      <input>
Step 1: number is 1101 and answer is 0
Step 2: answer is multiplied by 2 - it becomes 0
Step 3: Remove leftmost digit of number and add to answer
         number is now 101 and answer is 1
Step 4: number still has digits, go back to step 2
Step 2: answer is multiplied by 2 - it becomes 2
Step 3: Remove leftmost digit of number and add to answer
         number is now 01 and answer is 3
Step 4: number still has digits, go back to step 2
Step 2: answer is multiplied by 2 - it becomes 6
Step 3: Remove leftmost digit of number and add to answer
         number is now 1 and answer is 6
Step 4: number still has digits, go back to step 2
Step 2: answer is multiplied by 2 - it becomes 12
Step 3: Remove leftmost digit of number and add to answer
         number is now "" (empty) and answer is 13
Step 4: number is empty. We are done, the answer is 13.

    <p>As mentioned earlier, the advantage of this algorithm is that it very easily converts into relatively simple
      computer code. To demonstrate that, the algorithm is implemented in Python in the <em>codelens</em> below. You DO
      NOT need to worry about exactly how the Python language works. You will notice that turning the English algorithm
      above into code requires some changes, but the code shown follows the same process described above. See the
      <q>tips</q> box below the code lens for help running the program.</p>

    <program xml:id="datarepresentation_binaryconversions21" interactive="codelens" language="python">
      <input>
number = "1101"
answer = 0
while len(number) > 0:               #do next 3 lines until length of number is 0
    answer = answer * 2                 #multiply answer by 2
    answer = answer + int(number[0])    #add leftmost digit to answer
    number = number[1:]                 #remove leftmost digit

print("The final value of answer is", answer)
    </input>
    </program>
