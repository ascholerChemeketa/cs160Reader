  <title>Fractional Values</title>
  <p>We have learned to interpret binary numbers using place values based on powers of two. The value 1011 means 8 + 2 +
    1 or 11 as we can see in this table:</p>

  </table>
  <p>Normally we think of this table as starting from the ones and extending to the left, with each new column
    representing one larger power of two than the preceding column - making each column twice as large as the column to
    its right. If we want to move from left to right, we must divide the current columnâ€™s value by 2 to calculate
    the next column. If we do this to the Ones column, we would get <m>1/2</m> (<m>2^{-1}</m>), then <m>1/4</m> (<m>
    2^{-2}</m>), then <m>1/8</m> (<m>2^{-3}</m>), etc<ellipsis/></p>

  <p>These are the binary columns smaller than 1 that we have to work with: <m>1/2</m>, <m>1/4</m>, <m>1/8</m>,<ellipsis/>
    Any fractional value we want to represent, we must build using these fractions. Much like the decimal number <m>
    {0.34}_{10}</m> means 3 tenths and 4 one-hundredths, the binary number <m>{0.11}_2</m> means <m>1/2 + 1/4 =
    {0.75}_{10}</m></p>
  <p>Say I have the binary value <m>{0.0101}_2</m>. We can use the <q>table</q> method to convert the fractional
    value - we just need to line up the bits to the table so that the <q>.</q> falls on the line between 1 and
    1/2:</p>

    <p>Say I ask you to make 0.6 using just 4 places to the right of the binary point (In base 10 we call
      '.' the <term>decimal point</term>. In base 2 it is the <term>binary point</term>. The generic term
      for it is <term>radix point</term>.) Try using this table and a calculator or some scratch paper and see if you
      can figure out how to represent the value 0.6:</p>

    <p>It is a trick question. There is no way to exactly represent 0.6 given that set of options. (The closest you can
      come is 0.625).</p>
    <p>Difficulties in representing exact fractional values with a fixed number of digits are not unique to binary
      numbers. Say I ask you to represent 2/3 as a decimal with only 2 decimal places<ellipsis/> you could use 0.66, or
      0.67, but could not exactly represent 2/3. Each number system will have different values that are tricky to
      represent - although 0.6 is easy to represent in decimal - 6/10<superscript>ths</superscript> - it happens to be
      harder to represent in binary.</p>
    <important>
      <p>Often times when computers represent decimal fractions as binary numbers, the value stored is only an
        approximation of the true value. On the line below I have inserted code to have your web browser calculate the
        answer to 3 + .01 + .01:</p>
        <p>
      <raw format="html" xml:space="preserve"><script>document.writeln(3 + 0.01 + 0.01)</script></raw>
        </p>
      <p>Notice any issues? It turns out that 0.01 is hard to represent perfectly in binary.</p>
      <p>Computers can be programmed to store numbers as decimal values (encoding each decimal digit as 4 binary ones),
        but that is much less efficient and is not necessarily more accurate (as the decimal system still has trouble representing values like 1/3). But, if you are writing say financial software that needs to get exactly
        $3.02 when it adds two pennies to $3, you probably would be willing to use the less efficient representation!</p>
