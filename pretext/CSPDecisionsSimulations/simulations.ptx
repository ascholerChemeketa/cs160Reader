  <title>Simulations</title>

  <p>Computer-powered simulations have a wide variety of uses. Simulations are used to train people in professions
    ranging from pilots to surgeons. They are used to provide entertainment in the form of managing a virtual soccer
    team or driving a race car. And they are used to test out scientific theories and make predictions from them.</p>
