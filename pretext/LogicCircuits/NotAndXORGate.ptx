  <title>XOR and NOT Gates</title>
  <p>We can combine two inputs to produce an output using many rules other than <term>AND</term> or <term>OR</term>. We
    won&#8217;t worry about what the switches would look like for the new rules below&#8230; we would have to make our
    simplified model of an electric circuit more complex to see how they work. Instead, we will do what computer
    scientists normally do - abstract away from the actual electronics and focus on the logical rules they describe.</p>
    <subsection xml:id="xor-and-not-gate-xor">
      <title> XOR Gates</title>
  <p>The exclusive or gate, known as <term>XOR</term> describes a gate that only outputs a 1 only if one of the inputs
    is 1 and the other is 0. In other words, we can have either input on, but not both on.</p>

  <p>It is the logical rule we need if we want to decide the sign of a multiplication problem. If input 1 represents
    &#8220;the first number negative&#8221; and input 2 represents &#8220;the second number is negative&#8221;, then <term>
    XOR</term>&#8217;s output would tell us &#8220;Is the answer negative&#8221;. If either one of the two numbers, but
    not both of them, were negative, then the answer will be negative.</p>
  <p>Watch out for <term>XOR</term> and <term>OR</term> - in English we often use the word &#8220;or&#8221; to mean both
    things. The statement &#8220;Entr&#233;es come with fries <em>or</em> a salad&#8221; probably means you can get one
    or the other, but not both. In that statement, <em>or</em> means the <term>XOR</term> rule. On the other hand,
    imagine a class syllabus that states: &#8220;If you turn in copied work, <em>or</em> the wrong assignment, you will
    get a 0&#8221;. You would certainly get a 0 if you turned in a plagiarized copy of the wrong assignment (both parts
    are true). In this case, <em>or</em> means logical <term>OR</term> - if either part is true, the answer is true.</p>

<subsection xml:id="xor-and-not-gate-not">
  <title>NOT Gates</title>
  <p>The <term>NOT</term> gate is special in that it only has one input. The output is always the opposite of the input:</p>

  <p>The NOT operation is what we use if we have a truth value like &#8220;it is raining&#8221; but want to have the
    value for &#8220;it is not raining&#8221;. Anytime we want to say &#8220;We do not have X&#8221; we can say
    &#8220;NOT X&#8221;.</p>
  <p>Because the NOT rule applies to only one input, it can be applied to a single-bit pattern like 0101. To figure out
    the answer, simply &#8220;flip&#8221; every bit from 1 to 0 or vice verse:</p>

  <note>
    <p>People refer to an AND gate followed by a NOT as a NAND (Not-AND). That combination negates what the AND gate
      produces, producing the exact opposite - a NAND combo will produce an answer of 0 when both inputs are on and 1 in
      every other case. Similarly, a NOR is an OR followed by a NOT and an XNOR (or ENOR) is a NOT after an XOR. You are
      not responsible for memorizing the truth tables for these gates, but if you happen to see them, now you know what
      they are.</p>
