  <title>The AND Gate</title>
  <p>By changing the way wires run between our switches (the inputs) and the light (output), we can perform different
    Boolean operations. The circuit below demonstrates the Boolean rule <term>AND</term>. Notice that because there is
    one pathway through both switches from the battery to the light bulb, both switches must be in the on position to
    light the bulb:</p>

  <p>If either switch is off, that stops the current and the output is 0 (off):</p>

  </container>
  <p>What happens if both switches are off? If the first switch is off, the current is stopped there - it doesn’t
    really matter what state the second one is in, we know the output will be 0. Once again we can express this as a
    truth table. Note that we have the same four possible sets of inputs that we had for the OR gate: 00, 01, 10, or 11
    - any truth table describing a two-input circuit will always have those four possible inputs. What is different for
    the AND gate is the output produced by each possible set of inputs - it outputs a 1 only when both inputs are 1:</p>

  <p>Once again, the 1’s and 0’s can represent any Boolean (true/false) information. For instance, we could
    express the logic for determining whether or not a student got a B with this rule: <q>If your grade is greater
    than or equal to 80 AND your grade is less than 90, then you have a B</q>. The AND combines two true/false ideas
    (<q>your grade is > or = to 80</q>, <q>your grade is &lt; 90</q>) into one result (<q>you have
    a B</q>). If either of the two facts is false (i.e. your grade is less than 80 or it is 90 or above), then you do not have
    a B.</p>
