        <title>The AND Gate</title>
        <p>By changing the way wires run between our switches (the inputs) and the light (output), we can perform different Boolean operations. The circuit below demonstrates the Boolean rule <term>AND</term>. Notice that because there is one pathway through both switches from the battery to the light bulb, both switches must be in the on position to light the bulb:</p>

        <p>If either switch is off, that stops the current and the output is 0 (off):</p>

        </container>
        <p>What happens if both switches are off? If the first switch is off, the current is stopped there - it doesn&#8217;t really matter what state the second one is in, we know the output will be 0. Once again we can express this as a truth table. Note that we have the same four possible sets of inputs that we had for the OR gate: 00, 01, 10, or 11 - any truth table describing a two-input circuit will always have those four possible inputs. What is different for the AND gate is the outputs produced by each input - it outputs a 1 only when both inputs are 1:</p>

        <p>Once again, the 1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s can represent any Boolean (true/false) information. For instance, we could express the logic for determining whether or not a student got a B with this rule: &#8220;If your grade is greater than or equal to 80 AND your grade is less than 90, then you have a B&#8221;. The AND combines two true/false ideas (&#8220;your grade is &gt; or = to 80&#8221;, &#8220;your grade is &lt; 90&#8221;) into one result (&#8220;you have a B&#8221;). If either of the two facts is false (your grade is less 80 or it is 90 or above), then you do not have a B.</p>
