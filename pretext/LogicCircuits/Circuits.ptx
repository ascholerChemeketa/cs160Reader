  <title>Circuits</title>
  <p>Every circuit in a computer is made by wiring together switches (transistors) so they
  implement logic gates. These logic gates are used to store information, do math, and make comparisons, as well as
  everything else a computer can do.</p>
  <p>The diagrams for these circuits are drawn using the symbols shown below.
  Traditionally, the inputs to a gate come from the left, and the output comes out of the right side. That is why two
  lines are going into every gate but NOT<ellipsis/> every other gate requires two inputs.</p>

  <p>Key features:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>AND has a flat left side and is rounder, OR bends in on the left and is pointier</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>XOR looks just like OR but with an extra line behind it</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>NOT has a little circle at the tip of a triangle</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Below is an <term>OR</term>
  gate being used in a circuit. The power is wired to two push-button switches that function as the inputs to the
  circuit. The inputs can be turned off, in which case they do not transmit power, or on, in which case they allow power
  through (try clicking on the buttons inside <term>Input1</term> and <term>Input2</term> - the center will turn a
  different color when they are <q>on</q>). Those inputs feed into the left side of the <term>OR</term> gate. The
  output of the <term>OR</term> gate comes out of the right side and travels to the <term> Output</term>. If either one
  of the two Inputs is set to on (or both are), the Output should be on.</p>

    Try clicking the inputs to change them from off to on and back again. Observe what happens to the output.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>An input is ON when the center turns dark.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A red circle at the output or input to a gate indicates it is on. Black is off.</p>

        <li>
          <p>The final Output light turns bright red when it is on.</p>
