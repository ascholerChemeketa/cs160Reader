  <title>Chapter Summary</title>
  <p>This chapter included the following concepts from computing.</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>Comment</term> - A comment describes one or more lines of code. Comments are ignored by the computer. A
          comment in Python starts with <c>#</c>. The computer will ignore everything from the start of the comment to
          the end of that line.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Function</term> - A function returns a value. An example of a function is <c>Turtle()</c> which creates and
          returns a turtle object.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Procedure</term> - A procedure does an action, but doesnâ€™t return a value. An example of a
          procedure is <c>forward(100)</c> which makes the turtle go forward by 100 pixels.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
