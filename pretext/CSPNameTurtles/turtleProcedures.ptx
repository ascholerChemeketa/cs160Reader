  <title>Turtle Procedures</title>
  <p>Turtles can do more than go forward, turn left, and turn right. The table below lists more turtle procedures and
    functions.</p>

  </table>

  <p>To draw more than one letter you can use the <c>penup()</c> procedure after drawing the first letter to pick up the pen
    before moving to where you want to start the next letter. Once you are ready to draw again, use <c>pendown()</c>. The example
    below draws a C and an S.</p>
  <note>
    <p>In the sample we use blank lines to break up the code into logical chunks and comments to describe what each
      chunk does. The computer does not care about these things, but these tricks make it much easier for humans to
      understand what is happening.</p>

  <p>Try some experiments on the code:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Change the speed to a different value (1-10)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Try <url href="https://trinket.io/docs/colors" visual="https://trinket.io/docs/colors">looking up some other
          colors</url> and change what color the turtle draws with.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Try commenting out the code in the section called <c># Draw the S</c> to see how the turtle is repositioned after the C
          so it can start the S.</p>
