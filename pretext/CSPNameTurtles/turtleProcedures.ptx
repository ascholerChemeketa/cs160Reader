        <note>
            <p>You can find this table easily by look for &#8220;turtle - procedure list&#8221; in the book index.</p>
        </note>
        <p>To draw more than one letter you can use the <c>penup()</c> procedure after drawing the first
            letter to pick up the pen before moving to where you want to start the next letter. Once you
            are ready to draw again, use <c>pendown()</c>. The example below draws a C and an S.</p>
        <note>
            <p>In the sample we use blank lines to break up the code into logical chunks and comments to
                describe what each chunk does. The computer does not care about these things, but these
                tricks make it much easier for humans to understand what is happening.</p>
