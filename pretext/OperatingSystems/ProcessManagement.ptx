  <title>Process Management</title>
  <p>A computer program is just a static collection of code and data. Once we start running a program, there is dynamic
    information associated with that particular run of the program - things like the current instruction, the values
    that are stored in memory and the input the user has given. The word <term>process</term> refers to a computer
    program and the dynamic state associated with a particular execution of that program.</p>
  <p>Most modern operating systems are capable of <term>multi-tasking</term>, that is to say running more than one
    process at a time. Multiple programs can be running at the same time (including multiple copies of the same
    program). On a computer with a single processor core, only one of these processes can be running at any given time.
    The other processes all have to sit in a &#8220;ready queue&#8221; waiting their turn to run. Processes that are
    waiting for a slow event (like reading or writing a file to a hard drive) to complete and have no work to do until
    that finishes are put in a &#8220;waiting&#8221; state until the event completes.</p>
  <p>Hundreds of times a second, the hardware interrupts the running program and gives the operating system a chance to
    run. It also gets swapped into the processor to handle messages from the hardware (<em>&#8220;Hey, the mouse was
    clicked&#8221;</em>). Each time the OS is being run it processes any events that need to be handled and then
    restarts the program that was running. Aft
    er one program has been running for a certain period of time, the OS sends
    it back to the ready queue and picks a new program to run for a while. By switching tasks every few milliseconds,
    the processor makes it look like it is doing multiple things at once.</p>

  <p>Many modern CPUs feature multiple processing &#8220;cores&#8221; and can be running instructions from two or more
    processes at once. But the basic model still holds - each processing core is constantly switching between different
    processes, giving each a brief chance to run some instructions before switching to the next.</p>

    <title>What&#8217;s Happening?</title>
    <p>You can check what processes are currently running on your computer (and manage them) by pressing <em>
      ctrl-shift-esc</em> (Windows) or <em>command + option + escape</em> (OSX). On Windows then click &#8220;More
      details&#8221;.</p>
    <p>You will see not just the processes associated with programs you have intentionally started, but also all the
      little extra programs that started automatically when you booted the computer.</p>
